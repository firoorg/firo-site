LC is an anonymous developer that is interested in the cross-section between government, politics, state power, and technology.  Drawing from philosophers like Foucault, Fisher, Ellul, Ranciere, he is interested in individual human freedom, so he naturally gravitates to crypto anarchy.  He focuses on computer security, philosophy, and Python software development.  He follows the cypherpunk Bitstream Podcast by Frank Braun & Jonathan 'smuggler' Logan.
