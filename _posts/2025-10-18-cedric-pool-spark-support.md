We’re pleased to share that the [Cedric Crispin Mining Pool](https://www.cedric-crispin.com/), which added Firo in 2023, now supports **Spark Names** and **Spark Addresses** for block reward payouts!

This integration means miners can now receive their rewards **directly into their Spark Names or Spark addresses**, maintaining full confidentiality.
You can start mining Firo with Cedric Crispin at:

**Website**: [https://firo.cedric-crispin.com/](https://firo.cedric-crispin.com/)

**Stratum**:
* firo.cedric-crispin.com:4064
* firo.cedric-crispin.com:4065 (SSL)

The guide on **How to Mine Firo** on Cedric Crispin pool can be found [here](https://firo.cedric-crispin.com/start-mining/).

## What Are Spark Names and Spark Addresses?

[Spark Addresses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBh8nUTiy_A) are part of Firo’s Lelantus Spark protocol, allowing transactions that hide the sender, receiver, and amount while remaining fully verifiable. This provides true financial privacy on-chain.

[Spark Names](https://sparknames.firo.org/) make private transactions easier by replacing long, complex Spark addresses with simple, human-readable identifiers - like usernames for your wallet. This lowers the barrier to using privacy features while keeping everything fully private under the hood.

## Thank You to Cedric Crispin

We’d like to extend our gratitude to Cedric Crispin Mining Pool for their continued support of Firo. Their recent integration of Spark Names and Spark Addresses for block reward payouts enables privacy-conscious miners to receive rewards directly into their private Spark addresses.

Q: You've been a huge supporter of Firo, running a mining pool for a long time, can you tell us what motivated you to start one up?

I'm a computer nerd and I also graduated in computer science.
Running a mining pool was inevitable in my case since it touches things i love: networking, coding and blockchain.
I also wanted to be a contributor in the blockchain space. 

Q: What drew you to Firo? Anything that you are particularly excited about?

FIRO is one the first coins I mined, although it was still called ZCOIN back then.
The project has always been very vocal about its advocacy for POW. The switch from MTP to FIROPOW was the perfect reaffirmation.
So as soon as I found out there was actually a chance for me to be a contributor in term of stratum pool software, I did not hesitate a single moment.

Q: Why do you think miners in many PoW coins don't seem to care about decentralization of hashrate?

It's a tough question but I think the main reasons simply boil down to greed, lack of ethics and education.
Unfortunately some mining pools are also not ashamed and not afraid when it comes to exploiting those behaviors for their own benefits.

Q: Anything you would like to see in Firo or its ecosystem?

Of course more POW decentralization.
But I would also love to see miners more involved in community topics/debates/contributions.
FIRO has already implemented multiple fascinating and crucial features: Lelantus spark & FIRODEX. So I hope it will continue to create tools which will make the excessive selling pressure just for FIAT less compelling.
