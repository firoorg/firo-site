We are thrilled to announce that the [BasicSwap](https://basicswapdex.com/) installation wizard now comes with complete Firo compatibility! This means you can easily install Firo, featuring our recent groundbreaking [Lelantus Spark update](https://firo.org/2023/11/27/lelantus-spark-binaries-release.html), directly from the automated installer (remember to run it as an administrator).

## About Basicswap

BasicSwap stands as a decentralized, cross-chain trading exchange (DEX) that ensures privacy and security without relying on a central point of failure. This platform empowers users to seamlessly exchange cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Firo, free from restrictions or third-party intervention. Crafted by the cypherpunks at Particl, BasicSwap is deliberately constructed with an unwavering commitment to uncompromised privacy and security. This design is a direct response to the emerging challenges to freedom, reflecting a proactive stance against potential threats.

## Bidirectional Adaptor Signature Atomic Swaps?

Firo can swap as both the offerer and the participant of an adaptor signature swap.  Adaptor signature swaps present themselves as multi-signature transactions, concealing the true nature of the transaction and leaving no trace suggesting a connection between two transactions on distinct blockchains
