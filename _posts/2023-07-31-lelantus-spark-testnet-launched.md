## Spark testnet launched

As Firo continues to push the boundaries of privacy technology, we are excited to announce the launch of our Lelantus Spark Testnet to the public. This testnet provides an environment where developers and users can experiment, evaluate, and refine the Lelantus Spark protocol before its official release on mainnet. It allows us to identify and address any potential issues, fine-tune performance, and gather valuable feedback from the community. With this, we can ensure that Lelantus Spark is robust, reliable, and ready to deliver the next level of privacy to Firo users worldwide. 

## Simplifying Privacy with Spark addresses

Lelantus Spark introduces a flexible, privacy-preserving stealth addressing system that enhances privacy for recipients of transactions. Spark addresses are not searchable on the blockchain, so that no one can look up your address to see how much you hold or the timing of your transactions. Additionally, sender, receiver, and amounts are completely hidden when transacting between Spark addresses. More traditional addressing systems such as those used in Bitcoin and Ethereum allow anyone to look up the entire history of an address by putting them into a blockchain explorer. Spark addresses completely replace our previous (Receiver Address Privacy) RAP address system which will be sunsetting.

Unlike Firo's current privacy protocol Lelantus, users can send transparent funds directly into private Spark addresses without requiring the user to perform an additional anonymisation action, greatly simplifying the use of privacy-preserving transactions and its user experience. This also marks the first step of Firo's transition into mandatory privacy on all transactions.

## The Purpose of the Testnet

The Lelantus Spark testnet is a crucial step in Firo's commitment to rigorous testing and community involvement. By deploying the testnet, developers and users alike can assess the functionality, performance, and security of Lelantus Spark.

Feedback and insights gathered from the testnet participants will be invaluable in fine-tuning the protocol before its official launch on the mainnet. This iterative approach ensures that Lelantus Spark is robust, secure, and optimized to provide the highest levels of financial privacy for Firo users.

## How to use Testnet

Note: Please backup your mainnet **wallet.dat** BEFORE testing Spark testnet!!!

We will **NOT** be responsible for any wallet corruption.

1) Download the testnet binary 

a) [Windows](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/releases/download/v0.14.12.4/firo-0f292f6f0390-win64.zip)  
b) [Mac](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/releases/download/v0.14.12.4/firo-0f292f6f0390-osx-unsigned.dmg)  
c) [Linux](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/releases/download/v0.14.12.4/firo-0f292f6f0390-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz)  

2) Open command prompt/Terminal and launch firo-qt/firo-qt.exe with "-testnet" parameters. 

   Windows: `firo-qt.exe -testnet`  
   MAC: `open -a Firo-Qt --args -testnet`  
   Linux: `firo-qt -testnet`

Alternatively you can edit `firo.conf` in your FIRO [data directory](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/wiki/Default-data-directories) and add `testnet=1`

Launching the Firo-QT application will automatically launch testnet instead of mainnet.

5) Once synced, You are ready to use your testnet wallet. 

You can get testnet coins via the [Firo testnet Faucet](https://testexplorer.firo.org/faucet) or asking from the community via Firo [Telegram](https://t.me/firoorg) group or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TGZPRbRT3Y) You can lookup testnet transactions using our [testnet explorer](https://testexplorer.firo.org).

Note: Faucet currently only works with **Transparent-type** addresses. Please choose this type of address in the **Address** dropdown menu in the Receive tab.
