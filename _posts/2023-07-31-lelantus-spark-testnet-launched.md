## Spark testnet launched

As Firo continues to push the boundaries of privacy and security, we are excited to announce the launch of our Lelantus Spark Testnet. This testnet provides an environment where developers and users can experiment, evaluate, and refine the Lelantus Spark protocol before its official release on mainnet. It allows us to identify and address any potential issues, fine-tune performance, and gather valuable feedback from the community. With this, we can ensure that Lelantus Spark is robust, reliable, and ready to deliver the next level of privacy to Firo users worldwide. 

## Spark addresses 

Lelantus Spark introduces a revolutionary addressing system that enhances privacy for recipients of transactions. With Spark addresses, funds are kept hidden, protecting the user's privacy by preventing anyone from knowing the amount held or the timing of transactions. Previously, publicly shared addresses on the blockchain could be easily searched, revealing transaction details. 

However, Spark addresses eliminate this risk by allowing senders to generate one-time addresses on behalf of recipients, preventing easy linkage to specific transactions. This feature simplifies the process of anonymizing funds and promotes the use of Spark addresses as the default method for Firo transactions, ensuring enhanced privacy for users

## The Purpose of the Testnet

The Lelantus Spark testnet is a crucial step in Firo's commitment to rigorous testing and community involvement. By deploying the testnet, developers and users alike can assess the functionality, performance, and security of Lelantus Spark.


Feedback and insights gathered from the testnet participants will be invaluable in fine-tuning the protocol before its official launch on the mainnet. This iterative approach ensures that Lelantus Spark is robust, secure, and optimized to provide the highest levels of financial privacy for Firo users.
