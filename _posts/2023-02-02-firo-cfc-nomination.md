In June 2022 Firo implemented the [tokenomics change](https://www.firo.org/2022/05/08/firo-upcoming-tokenomics-change.html) that the community voted for which created the Firo Community Fund. 
The Firo Community Fund was created to bring greater decentralization in funding to the project by creating an independent fund from the block reward and which would be run by community elected members. 
In July 2022 the Firo community [elected the first Community Fund Committee](https://www.firo.org/2022/07/04/community-fund-committee-elected.html) which was made up of the following members: 

@RyanApeFiro
@FiroHero
@rehrar
@OhGodaGirl
@sproxet
@rasikhmorani
@nrsimha

Due to the Community Fund being a new introduction, it was decided that for the first round of Committee Members, the role would only be for 6 months after which there would be a new election and thereafter it would be for 1-year terms.

To date, the Community Fund has assisted with funding the Lelantus Spark audit, and various community management roles and assisted the core team in market making, research, and development expenses.

Their terms have ended, and it is now time for new nominations and another Firo Community Fund Committee to be elected! 

### Requirements & Eligibility

Cannot be a current full-time member of the Firo core team. Part-time contributors or contractors of Firo’s core team are allowed but must be disclosed.

Be able to attend a CFC meeting once a month or appoint a proxy to do the same (though proxies should be used sparingly).

While a technical or development background isn’t required, having a few committee members with some coding background would be helpful in evaluating proposals.

### How to Run for Election
