We are happy to share the progress of the [security retainer](https://magicgrants.org/Security-Retainer-with-HashCloak/) we have with [HashCloak](https://hashcloak.com/). HashCloak’s expertise has significantly improved the security and robustness of Firo’s Spark codebase.

## Progress on Fuzzing Code Coverage:

The mainstay of our recent endeavours has been expanding Firo’s fuzzing code coverage. 

Code fuzzing, or fuzz testing, is an automated software testing technique that involves feeding a program with a wide range of randomised inputs in hopes of discovering errors, vulnerabilities, and unexpected behaviours. Once set up, fuzzing tests can run continuously without much intervention, ensuring that new vulnerabilities that might be introduced with new code updates are quickly identified. While audits, unit tests and manual testing can miss out on certain scenarios, fuzz testing can potentially cover a broader range of input combinations, increasing the likelihood of catching issues especially those edge case ones..

The results speak for themselves:

| File                  | Previous Coverage (%) | Current Coverage (%) |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| aead.cpp              | 31                    | 95.0%                |
| bech32.cpp            | 7%                    | 90.1%                |
| bpplus.cpp            | 6%                    | 93.5%                |
| chaum.cpp             | 3%                    | 48.5%                |
| coin.cpp              | 7%                    | 51.5%                |
| f4grumble.cpp         | 9%                    | 96.2%                |
| grootle.cpp           | 0.8%                  | 90.7%                |
| mint_transaction.cpp  | 0%                    | 40.5%                |
| schnorr.cpp           | 0%                    | 96.5%                |
| spend_transaction.cpp | 0%                    | 14.0%                |

## Review of Pull Requests

During the retainer period, HashCloak also assisted in the review of three significant PRs from Firo:

1) HashCloak reviewed a proposal related to updating Lelantus Spark's linking tag structure that was intended to allow more flexible membership proof upgrading options. The review identified a potential flaw in the proposed modification, leading to the withdrawal of the change. [Review the PR here](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/pull/1267).

2) HashCloak also conducted thorough evaluations on two other PRs from the core team addressing a glitch in the Lelantus state change and a Spark runaway exception and the feedback will be incorporated in the final merge.

## Wrapping Up

We look forward to continuing the security retainer with HashCloak to further increase fuzzing code coverage and to review any critical pull requests, especially with the upcoming launch of our new privacy protocol Lelantus Spark on mainnet.

We would like to extend special thanks to [MAGIC](https://magicgrants.org/) for facilitating this and the generous donations from the Firo community and [Arcadia Group](https://arcadia.agency/) that made this possible.
