We are thrilled to announce that MAGIC Grants has approved a grant from the MAGIC Firo Fund to integrate Firo, a leading privacy-preserving cryptocurrency, with the [Enkrypt](https://www.enkrypt.com/) wallet. The integration work will be spearheaded by [BlockStars](https://blockstars.tech/), a renowned web3 development company. This collaboration will include full support for Spark, enhancing the usability and accessibility of Firo within a multi-chain ecosystem. We expect the work to take about 3 months.

## Elevating Privacy and Accessibility with Enkrypt

The integration of Firo into Enkrypt wallet marks a significant milestone in our mission to provide users with seamless and secure access to privacy-focused financial solutions. Enkrypt is not just another crypto wallet; it's a true multichain browser extension wallet developed by [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/). With support for over 70 natively integrated chains—including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, and many more—Enkrypt offers a unified platform for managing diverse digital assets.

### Why Enkrypt?
