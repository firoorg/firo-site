Firo is now available on Bison Wallet, a community-driven, self-custodial wallet within the Decred ecosystem that enables secure, private, and trustless trading via DCRDEX.

This integration means the Firofam can:
* **Trade peer-to-peer via atomic swaps** – Trade directly peer-to-peer via atomic swaps. No intermediaries, no custodial risk
* **Maintain full self-custody** – Your keys, your coins
* **Access enhanced privacy features** 
* **Enjoy cost-effective trading**  – Ultra-low transaction fees on most chains

## Why This Matters for Firo

Bison Wallet aligns perfectly with Firo’s values:
* **Decentralization** – No reliance on centralized exchanges
* **Privacy** – Trade without KYC or surveillance
* **User sovereignty** – Full control over your assets
