We're excited to announce that Firo is partnering with [Rosen Bridge](https://rosen.tech/) to enable cross-chain asset transfers, opening the door to some of the largest decentralized finance ecosystems and liquidity venues in cryptocurrency.

Through this integration, Firo will become accessible on Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Cardano. Integrations to Base and other prominent EVMs are also in the works. Home to billions of dollars in decentralized exchange liquidity and a thriving landscape of DeFi applications all without relying on centralized intermediaries.

## Why This Matters

Over the past few years, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies have faced an increasingly hostile environment on centralized exchanges. Regulatory pressure and compliance concerns have led to widespread delistings, restricting access for users who simply want to transact with financial privacy.

This reality underscores a fundamental lesson: relying on centralized gatekeepers is incompatible with the ethos of censorship-resistant money. If a privacy coin can be removed from circulation with a policy decision, its utility as permissionless currency is compromised at the infrastructure level.

Cross-chain bridges offer a path forward. By enabling Firo to be represented on decentralized exchanges across multiple ecosystems, we reduce dependence on any single point of failure. Users can acquire, hold, and trade Firo through permissionless protocols that no centralized entity can unilaterally shut down.

## Why Rosen Bridge

Rosen Bridge stands out for several reasons that align with Firo's values:

**Decentralized architecture.** Rosen employs a two-layer security model consisting of Watchers (who monitor and report cross-chain events) and Guards (who verify and execute transactions). Both layers require economic collateral and operate under multi-signature constraints, meaning no single entity controls the bridge.

**Multi-layered verification.** Each Watcher observes the network independently rather than relying on other Watchers' reports, preventing fault cascades. A finalized report only proceeds if enough distinct Watchers confirm the same event. Guards then independently verify these reports before processing, and transactions require signatures from a quorum of Guards. So no small group of compromised actors can generate arbitrary transactions.

**Skin in the game.** Both Watchers and Guards must lock collateral (RSN and ERG tokens) to participate. Malicious behaviour results in slashed funds, creating strong economic disincentives against misconduct.

**Open source and auditable.** All Rosen Bridge code is [publicly accessible](https://github.com/rosen-bridge) for review. Every bridge event is tracked on the Ergo blockchain, creating a transparent audit trail.

**Scalable design.** Rosen's modular architecture allows new chains to be integrated through independent, chain-specific modules, positioning this partnership for expansion as additional ecosystems become relevant.

## What This Means for Firo Users

Once the integration is live, Firo holders will be able to bridge their assets to Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Cardano, gaining access to:

* Deep liquidity on established DEXes like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Cardano-native exchanges.
* Participation in DeFi protocols including lending, liquidity provision, and yield generation.
* A censorship-resistant on-ramp and off-ramp that operates independently of centralized exchange policies.

This isn't about chasing DeFi trends. It's about building resilient infrastructure. When centralized access points fail, decentralized alternatives must exist. Rosen Bridge provides exactly that.

## Looking Ahead

This partnership represents a strategic step in ensuring Firo remains accessible and liquid regardless of the regulatory climate surrounding privacy technologies. We believe that financial privacy is a fundamental right, and that belief must be backed by infrastructure that cannot be switched off.

We'll share further details on the integration timeline but development is already underway and progressing quickly.
We have also secured commitments from Firo holders to bridge meaningful amounts of Firo once the bridge is live ensuring strong bootstrapped liquidity upon launch.

Privacy isn't just a feature. It's infrastructure worth defending.
