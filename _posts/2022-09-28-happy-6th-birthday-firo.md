Firo was launched as Zcoin on 28 September 2016 and our project is now 6 years old! We have grown tremendously as a project and we thought it would be a good opportunity to have a look back at what was achieved in the past year since our last birthday (28 September 2021)!  

### TECHNICAL  

* [FiroPoW]({{ site.baseurl }}/2021/10/01/firopow-and-instantsend-release.html) was activated on October 2021 which replaced our previous mining algorithm MTP making our coin ASIC/FPGA resistant and reducing the amount of overhead needed.
* [InstantSend]({{ site.baseurl }}/2021/10/01/firopow-and-instantsend-release.html) was activated on October 2021 making all transactions final within a few seconds without having to wait for block confirmation.
* The [First Firo mobile wallet]({{ site.baseurl }}/2021/12/16/firo-mobile-wallet-release-with-lelantus.html) with Lelantus privacy tech support was released. This wallet automatically anonymized any received Firo. [Campfire]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/03/01/campfire-firo-wallet.html), an open source Firo wallet was also released as a joint effort between Cypher Stack and Arcadia.
* [MTP Data stripping]({{ site.baseurl }}/2021/12/19/mtp-stripping-live-on-firo.html) Extraneous data in old MTP blocks were stripped out allowing Firo’s blockchain to reduce its size from 60+ GB to around 4 GB. 
* Firo GUI UI on both Firo-QT and Electron (Rich GUI) was [refreshed with a new look]({{ site.baseurl }}/2021/12/17/firo-wallet-gui-refresh.html) to reflect the Firo branding.
* [Block time was reduced to 2.5 minutes]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/05/08/firo-upcoming-tokenomics-change.html) on June 17th, 2022. This allows for faster confirmations even for exchanges or wallets that do not support Firo’s InstantSend.
* [Elysium was launched on testnet]({{ site.baseurl }}/2021/12/22/elysium-testnet-and-gui.html) and is now in release candidate status. Final bug fixes and rounds of tests are being done before releasing to the public.
* [FiroDEX]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/02/22/firodex-released.html), a cross-chain atomic swap DEX powered by AtomicDEX is released allowing Firo to be swapped in a decentralized manner across major chains such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche and others.

### RESEARCH  

* The [Lelantus Spark Cryptography Audit by Hashcloak]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/01/04/lelantus-spark-audit-complete.html) has been completed. It was funded by the community and core team funds via the Firo Crowdfunding System.
* We introduced [Helsing]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/01/28/helsing-private-firo-masternode.html), which enables a Private Firo Masternode in Lelantus Spark.
* [Spark Assets (Spats)]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/03/07/spats-confidential-assets-lelantus-spark.html) were revealed that extend Lelantus Spark Technology to support confidential tokens/assets which hide the sender, receiver, amount, and also the asset being transferred.
* The [Lelantus Spark paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1173) was accepted into the 6th Workshop on Trusted Smart Contracts organized by the International Financial Cryptography Association.

### TOKENOMICS AND THE FIRO COMMUNITY FUND  

* After three rounds of polling, the [community voted]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/05/08/firo-upcoming-tokenomics-change.html) for a change in the distribution of block rewards: 50% Masternodes, 25% Miners 10% Community Fund 15% Development Fund. Emission remains unchanged.
* The [Community Fund Committee]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/07/04/community-fund-committee-elected.html) (CFC) was formed and elected from the community members to oversee the newly formed Community Fund. They are a well-rounded mix of well-established community members, subject matter experts and developers which are independent from the core team.
* The CFC approved a [bonus mining rewards campaign]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/09/10/cfc-bonus-mining-reward.html) to decentralize mining hashrate. This gives a 10% bonus over the block reward to any pool operator that has less than 30% total hashrate.
* The CFC approved for the Community Fund to be utilized to fund the balance required for the [Lelantus Spark code audit by Hashcloak](https://funding.firo.org/proposals/lelantus-spark-code-audit-proposal-by-hashcloak-mikerahq)
