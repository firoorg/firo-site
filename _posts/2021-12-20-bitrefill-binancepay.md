With Firo’s recent [Binance Pay integration]({{ site.baseurl }}/2021/11/25/firo-binance-pay.html), Firo is now spendable on many more merchants. [BitRefill](https://www.bitrefill.com/) now has Firo as an option via Binance Pay which opens the door to a whole range of gift cards and top up vouchers of big name vendors such as Google, Twitch, Amazon, Grab, Uber, Steam, Ikea and many more with a total of 4000+ products.
