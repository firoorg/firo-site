We are happy to open our [Lelantus](https://firo.org/2019/04/14/lelantus-firo.html) testnet to the public!

We would like to thank Mintpond for all their assistance and for providing the [testnet pool](https://testnet.mintpond.com/#!/firo).

## Getting Started

**Please be careful and for safety do not run the testnet binaries without the testnet flag as this may corrupt your current wallet**

**There is an open issue that affects encrypted wallets. So don’t encrypt your testnet wallets yet. The issue will be fixed in the next few days**

You can download the testnet release from our [Github releases page](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/releases) and it will be marked as a pre-release.

## Resources

- [Testnet Explorer](https://testexplorer.zcoin.io/)
- [Faucet](https://testexplorer.zcoin.io/faucet)
- [Testnet Pool](https://testnet.mintpond.com/#!/firo)

If anyone needs testnet FIRO you can either mine it, use the testnet faucet, or request some from a team member in the [Zcoin Telegram channel](https://telegram.me/firoproject) and we will send you some testnet Firo to play around with.

## What’s Next?

The testnet phase will take about 4 to 6 weeks before we release the mainnet binaries. We will continue to make various bug fixes on outstanding issues before code freezing and will update the testnet binaries from time to time.

Your feedback is invaluable!
