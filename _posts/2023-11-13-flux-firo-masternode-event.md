Beginning on **November 13, 2023** till **December 13, 2023** Flux extends an invitation to the Firo community to take part in this fantastic opportunity. Flux Cloud proudly presents the Firofam with the chance to operate Firo Masternode on their platform for a period of 3 months, and the best part? They are fully reimbursing your deployment costs!

This initiative commemorates our longstanding partnership with Flux since the earliest days of Zcoin, now Firo. They have been a pivotal partner since the introduction of Masternodes on the Firo network.

## What is Flux?

Flux is a decentralized Web3 cloud infrastructure comprised of user-operated, scalable and globally distributed computational nodes. It provides a suite of computing services and a blockchain as a service, enabling developers to create and manage applications on Web3. The Flux ecosystem consists of components like the FLUX blockchain, operating network, native app FluxOS, and a multi-asset crypto wallet, ZelCore.

## What's in it for you:

1. **Free Firo Masternode Hosting:** Throughout November and December, you can deploy and operate a Firo Masternode on the Flux Cloud platform at zero cost. The deployment cost of 25.83 Flux will be reimbursed which means you can enjoy the benefits of Firo's Masternode network without any expenses.

2. **Automatic Reimbursement:** They understand the importance of trust, and have made the reimbursement process seamless. They will handle reimbursements from their end, so you don't need to reach out to any support desk. Expect your reimbursement to be processed within one week of your deployment, to the same address you used for the initial payment.

3. **Effortless Setup Guides:** Whether you've just gotten enough Firo to make a Masternodes or an experienced operator, they have got you covered. They will provide comprehensive [setup guides](https://help.runonflux.io/categories/firo/) to walk you through the process of deploying a new Masternode or migrating your existing one from your current setup.

Flux is also introducing a special raffle event!

4. **Competitive FLUX Raffle:** Three fortunate Firo Masternode deployments will have a chance to win 500 FLUX each. The raffle will take place on **December 14, 2023**. If you have multiple Firo Masternodes deployed, your chances of winning in the raffle significantly increase, so the more you deploy, the more you can maximize your opportunities.

### How to Participate:

1. **Deploy or Migrate Your Firo Masternode:** Follow their [setup guides](https://help.runonflux.io/categories/firo/) to deploy a new Masternode on Flux Cloud or migrate your existing one. Ensure you choose the right 3-month subscription plan Masternode on the Flux Marketplace, named: FiroMN3!

2. **Wait for Reimbursement & Earn Rewards:** Sit back and relax while they reimburse your costs and begin monitoring your incoming Masternode block rewards.

3. **Participate in the Raffle:** With each additional Masternode you deploy, your odds in the raffle improve. The raffle winners will be announced on December 14, 2023.
