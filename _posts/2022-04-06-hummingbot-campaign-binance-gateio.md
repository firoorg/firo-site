We are happy to announce the restart of the Firo Hummingbot liquidity mining program. This time in addition to rewards in $FIRO, you’ll also be receiving [$HBOT tokens](https://support.hummingbot.io/hc/en-us/articles/5440378738713-Launching-HBOT-Rewards-on-Hummingbot-Miner). The program rewards users who provide liquidity to the following pairs:

FIRO/USDT > [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37748947)  
FIRO/USDT > [Gate.io](https://www.gate.io/signup/2777405)  

* The links above contain referral links which would help support Firo’s core team’s efforts if you sign up to those exchanges through the link.  

To get started:
1. Sign up on [Hummingbot Miner](https://miner.hummingbot.io/) with your email address.
2. Install, configure and run Hummingbot. Read the [guide here](https://hummingbot.io/academy/quickstart/). You can also get help on [Hummingbot’s Discord](https://discord.hummingbot.io/).
3. Get Paid: Accumulate token rewards every minute. Get paid at the end of the week.  

Note that liquidity only counts towards rewards where they are within +-2% spread and the closer it is to the market price, the more rewards you will earn!

For full details and other terms and conditions, you can read [Hummingbot’s Liquidity Mining policy](https://hummingbot.io/en/liquidity-mining-policy/).

Help contribute to $FIRO’s liquidity and get rewarded!
