We are pleased to announce the launch of Spark Names testnet!

This testnet release provides a dedicated environment for developers and users to experiment, evaluate, and refine Spark Names ahead of its mainnet launch. By enabling real-world testing, we aim to identify and address any potential issues that may not surface during internal development.

Your participation and feedback are invaluable as we work together to ensure Spark Names delivers a seamless and privacy-focused experience. Join us in testing and shaping the future of Firoâ€™s address system!
