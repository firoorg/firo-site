With the upcoming supply halving in mid September of this year, many community members have raised whether the block reward distribution or tokenomics of Firo will be revisited. The last time this was done was in [May 2022](https://forum.firo.org/t/tokenomics-and-funding-division-of-block-reward-discussion-and-community-matching-fund/2061).

Link to the 2024 Firo Tokenomics Discussion with upcoming Halving thread is located [here](https://forum.firo.org/t/firo-tokenomics-discussion-with-upcoming-halving/3162).

Currently it is divided as follows:

* 50% Masternodes 
* 25% Miners 
* 15% Dev reward 
* 10% Community Fund 

Based on the current code, if no change is made, the development fund and community fund will be ceased and the block reward will go 50% to miners and 50% to masternodes.

This was a deliberate decision to ensure that if there is any extension of the development or community fund, it would require community’s support and feedback rather than just maintaining the existing division.

There are three questions that need to be answered:

**1. What should the block division be after the halving?**

This is self-explanatory and basically regulates what should be the respective percentages between masternodes, miners, development fund and community fund or should the funds exist at all.

**2. Should the existing halving schedule be maintained or should it be relooked at?**

We follow Bitcoin’s halving schedule which halves every 4 years. While this served Bitcoin well and was suitable when there was no ecosystem at all, the industry has changed and most projects now have faster emission cycles and are already almost fully emitted with only a tail emission remaining (for e.g. XMR).
Also to consider whether halvings every 4 years are correct or instead adopt a more gradual reduction of supply.

**3. Whether we should consider adopting a tail emission with/without dynamic blocks**

Personally, while this problem is not going to happen for a while, it would be good to answer this sooner rather than later. I strongly believe in the need for a tail emission to have stable security instead of one that fluctuates based on the transaction volume which ebbs and wanes. The only value of not having a tail emission is to say ‘fixed supply’ which is a strong narrative for many people. Bitcoin will face this problem sooner than us so another option is just to wait for them to face those issues and then adapt it then.

Before anyone weighs in as this is a very important decision, I hope everyone considers the following:

1) Thinking that masternodes will become unprofitable if no change is done is not necessarily true. Masternodes rewards are a fixed amount spread across the number of masternodes. If hosting a masternode becomes unprofitable, they will drop off and economic equilibrium will be re-established as now less masternodes are now sharing the reward. We currently have over 4000 active masternodes, even in the worst case, dropping to 2000 still provides good security.

2) Development of Spark has been delivered and the most difficult parts of our tech stack have been more or less delivered. If core team’s fund is extended, this will lead to the development of Spats (Spark Assets), the transition of mining/masternode rewards to Spark and/or curve trees (that will give global anon sets). The community needs to decide whether it values these additions or should development move to pure maintenance which requires a much smaller budget.

3) I would advocate against removing mining rewards completely. While their role in the ecosystem has diminished for quite a few years now, to move to a pure masternode model requires a lot of technical challenges since the masternode model was always designed to be together with PoW. While it might be tempting to move to a PoS model or so, I personally think our development time is better spent on developing game-changing features that improve the privacy and utility of Firo (such as Spats and Curve Trees). I forsee that some mining pools would drop support of Firo with the reduced mining rewards in any case.

4) Community should weigh whether it wishes to continue the Community Fund and whether it values its role as an independent body outside the core team. While a lot of its funds have been used in supporting the core team, it has funded good proposals such as Vosto Emisio’s graphic design proposal which forms the basis of our social media postings and also various audits. Should the Community Fund Committee have a bigger role in governance?

I have many other thoughts on the issue but will post this first to start the ball rolling!
