We are glad to announce that the Firo hard fork has been successfully completed.
Firo’s latest hard fork activated at block 1,205,100 without issues.

This upgrade introduces two major improvements to the Firo network:

## Spark Name Transfers

Users can now transfer, buy, and sell Spark Names on-chain, enabling a new Firo-native economy around privacy-preserving digital identities.

## Lower GPU VRAM Requirements for Mining

This hard fork reduces the VRAM requirements for FiroPoW miners, making mining more accessible and allowing 8 GB graphics cards to mine Firo again.

We would like to thank all exchanges, mining pools, nodes and masternodes for the smooth transition.

If you run a node, masternode, or the QT Reference Wallet, please ensure you are updated to the [latest version](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/releases).
You may need to perform a reindex if you updated after the hard fork: [https://firo.org/guide/reindex-wallet.html](https://firo.org/guide/reindex-wallet.html)
