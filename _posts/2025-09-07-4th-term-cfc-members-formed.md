The 7 member Community Fund Committee (“CFC”) is formed to oversee the Firo Community Fund (“FCF”) has been completed!

The following community members will serve as CFC members for a period of 1 year:

* Firofan
* Rehrar
* Jagmot
* Fiendish
* Nrsimha
* Ddadybayo
* Centaurea

The newly elected committee brings together long-standing community members, technical experts, and developers who have consistently participated in proposal reviews and guided the allocation of the Firo Community Fund.

We would like to extend our gratitude to the newly elected members for serving on the Firo Community Fund (FCF) and for contributing to the decentralization of funding decisions. We also sincerely thank the outgoing committee members for their dedication and service to the project.

## How to apply for funding from the Firo Community Fund

Anyone is welcome to request funding from the FCF by submitting a proposal through the [Firo Crowdfunding System](https://funding.firo.org/) and opening a [forum thread](https://forum.firo.org/c/fcs-proposals/16) to invite community discussion. In addition, the Community Fund Committee has the authority to put forward proposals of their own for consideration.

## What are the responsibilities of the Community Fund Committee?

1. To decide along with taking into account community feedback on how the Firo Community Fund should be utilised.
2. To help evaluate community requests for funding, do due diligence of applicants applying for funding and obtain all necessary information to ensure sufficient detail for scope of work.
3. To evaluate and approve payment of milestone requests.
4. To make all reasonings of the CFC for approval/rejection public.
5. CFC can request for the core team’s feedback and opinion on proposals.
6. To always conduct themselves with professionalism without resorting to personal attacks or insults.

## How will the Firo Community Fund (FCF) be utilised?

1. FCF funds must always be utilised for the benefit of Firo. Research, development or promotional activities that do not directly benefit Firo should not be undertaken.
2. All FCF expenditure has to be disclosed. Any proposal that does not allow this will not be able to be funded from the FCF.
3. FCF funds should not be used for giveaways even for the purpose of promoting adoption or participation.
4. FCF funds should not be used to host purely social events. Educational or awareness events are acceptable but must be the primary component of the event.
5. FCF funds should be used and while there shouldn’t be a pressure to spend funds, the FCF should not be hoarded.
6. CFC can choose to use the FCF to employ contractors to embark on specific tasks or roles that will report directly to the CFC.
7. Should the CFC deem fit, FCF funds can be burnt by sending it to this [burn address](https://explorer.firo.org/address/aFiroBurningAddressDoNotSendrPtjYA).
