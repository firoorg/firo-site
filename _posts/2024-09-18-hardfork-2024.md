The hard fork implementing the latest tokenomics changes as voted in by the community has been completed successfully. This upgrade introduces significant changes to our block reward distribution, emission model, and overall sustainability. Read more about these changes in our previous blog post on it [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/09/01/finalized-tokenomics-2024.html).

A huge thank you to our amazing ecosystem of masternode providers, mining pools, and the supportive community who voted in the [finalization of the community polls]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/09/01/finalized-tokenomics-2024.html) and ensured a smooth transition. Together, we continue to create a place in privacy and decentralization in Firo!

The core team will be posting an updated proposed roadmap soon so stay tuned!
