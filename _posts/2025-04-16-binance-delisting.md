Trading on Binance for Firo has now been halted. While Binance is giving a grace period until to 16 June 2025 to withdraw your Firo, we encourage our Firo Fam to withdraw and self custody their Firo as soon as possible. Note that Binance from time to time suspends their withdrawals so ensure you do it soon for peace of mind.

We recommend to [use our wallets here.](https://firo.org/get-firo/download/)

You can also [refer to our guides to do so here.](/guide/exchange-withdrawal-guide.html)

Binance has informed us that they will continue to honor redemptions of Binance Smart Chain BEP20 Firo to native FIRO 1:1 but it is unclear whether they would allow withdrawal of native FIRO past 16 June 2025. We recommend converting this by depositing it to Binance and withdrawing it to native FIRO as soon as possible.

Our guides to [convert BEP20 Firo to native Firo are here.](/guide/exchange-withdrawal-guide.html#converting-bep20-firo-to-native-firo)

Thereafter you can withdraw to your own wallets as per the withdrawal guides above.

If you want to trade Firo and deposit them to other centralized exchanges, note that some exchanges will forfeit your deposits if you directly send from Spark (such as HTX) so ensure you send from a transparent address. Transparent addresses either start with an "a" or "Z" while Spark addresses always start with "sm".

As always we recommend users to self custody instead and trade and provide liquidity on non custodial platforms like FiroDEX, Bison Wallet and BasicSwapDEX. We will be working on more detailed guides on how to use these platforms soon to be truly self sovereign and private.
