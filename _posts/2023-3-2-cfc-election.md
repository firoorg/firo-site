As of the end of February, the [Community Fund Committee nomination](https://forum.firo.org/t/cfc-nomination-thread-february-2023/2842) stage has ended!
Here is the list of nominees for the general election of the new CFC! 

### CFC Candidates

Forum / Telegram / Discord

* @devwarrior / @Dev_Warrior / @devwarrior#5709
* @Eagle / @eagleblac / @EagleKARTAL#2419
* @Fiendish / @FiroFiend / @Fiendish#6111 (Reelection)

* @RyanApeFiro / @moviecheff / @ry_alt#6800 (Reelection)
* @sproxet / @sproxet / @sproxet#5932 (Reelection)

All 7 seats are up for the taking! Out of these 9 nominees, only 7 can be elected! 
I hoped that the Firo community will take their time and carefully consider the options before settling on their voting choices. After our [previous CFC election](https://forum.firo.org/t/firo-community-fund-committee-elections/2509), the seven who were elected were as follows:

* RyanApeFiro
* FiroHero
* Rehrar
* OhGodaGirl
* Sproxet
* RasikhMorani
* Nrsimha

Their terms were for 6 months (which has lasted a little over that), but the new CFC will be elected for a term of 1 year. Thank you all for taking the time to serve the Firo community! Thank you to those who have been nominated and accepted a nomination to do the same! 
There will be a brief informal interview with each of the nominees, the transcripts of which will be made available in the thread for this CFC General Election. 

### Requirements for voting

This vote is critical, so we urge you all to do the research before casting your votes. These members of the Firo community will be serving this role for 1 year - do not take your responsibility of voting lightly! You are playing a critical part in the future of Firo!
