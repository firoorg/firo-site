FIRO reopens for trading on Binance in 6 European countries

In May 2023, [Binance made Firo and several other privacy coins unavailable in several European countries](https://www.theblock.co/post/232751/binance-privacy-coins-delisting-europe) namely Poland, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Sweden, due to new EU regulations restricting the trading of privacy coins.

With Binance completing the transition to EX addresses for FIRO, Firo is now reopened for trading in these countries with immediate effect. If you are in an affected country, you might receive an e-mail notification from Binance informing you of this.

EX addresses are not meant for regular users to create but for exchanges that require them for regulatory reasons. However, users will need to interact with EX addresses if they are depositing into Binance or another exchange that deploys them.

### Transition Notes

Binance has rolled out EX addresses for the vast majority of users, though some are in the midst of migration. Please ensure that even if you do not have an EX address yet, do not send funds from Spark directly to Binanceâ€™s deposit address. Otherwise, they will be frozen until you open a support ticket with Binance to return the funds to you. **This process can take up to 30 working days.**

EX addresses only accept FIRO from transparent addresses. If you have funds held in Spark, you would first need to send them to a transparent address before sending them to the EX address. At the time of writing, the only exchange that uses EX addresses are Binance.

Most exchanges do not yet support withdrawals to an EX address, so you would need to withdraw from your own wallet first with a transparent address before sending the money to Binance. We are in communication with other centralized exchanges to facilitate easy exchange-to-exchange transfers. At the time of writing, only NonKYC.io supports direct withdrawals to an EX address. You can also do your part by opening a ticket with your favourite exchange or wallet to encourage them to support sending to EX addresses.

Most major exchanges such as MEXC, HTX and Gate support FIRO deposits from EX addresses so you can send from Binance to these exchanges directly. Always test with a small amount first if unsure!
