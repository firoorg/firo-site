We have launched a [liquidity mining farm for FIRO/BNB](https://bsc.valuedefi.io/#/vfarm/0xffb62cebd566062991157ea7a24fff94d0a92b0c) on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) with [ValueDefi!](https://bsc.valuedefi.io/#/) Liquidity incentives will run from block [6703000](https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/6703000) (approximately Monday, April 19 2021, at 21:10:41 GMT+0800) to block [8303000](https://bscscan.com/block/countdown/8303000) (approximately Monday, June 14 2021, at 10:30:38 GMT+0800).

Users can earn BEP20 FIRO by providing liquidity to ValueDefi's vFarm pool on the FIRO/BNB pair with the ratio 70/30.

This vFarm represents our first incentivized liquidity pool on BSC and will help us assess the community's interest in participating in DeFi. It will also help jumpstart the liquidity of BEP20 Firo on BSC.

Those preferring to participate on the Ethereum network can do so on our [Sushiswap pair.]({{ site.baseurl }}/2021/03/29/stfiro-sushiswap.html)

## Converting native FIRO to BEP20 Firo

To provide liquidity you'll need to convert your native Firo to BEP20 Firo. You can either do so via the [Binance Bridge](https://www.binance.org/en/bridge#) or through a withdrawal of Firo from Binance and then selecting Binance Smart Chain as the transfer network.
