As part of our efforts to create sustainable and decentralized funding mechanisms for the Zcoin project, we are proud to join the Open Source Collective via OpenCollective. This supplements our Zcoin Crowdfunding System that is used to fund specific tasks and even third party development.

If you would like to support our work at Zcoin, consider making a one-time or recurring donation!

The Open Source Collective is a non-profit umbrella organisation providing financial and legal infrastructure for thousands of open source projects. It’s an API between the world of distributed collaboration and the world of accounting and invoices.

Having the Open Source Collective as our fiscal host allows us to receive donations with minimum hassle and also allow recurring payments to be set up! All expenses are transparent and need to be supported with relevant documentation for full transparency to the community.

You can also check out Alyssa Wright’s interview of Reuben [here](https://blog.opencollective.com/firo/) with the full transcript available [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j_Ly5iJ-r6i1DMemTcob2n_KUyk-SsAnk56Cvr6G5j0/edit?usp=sharing)
