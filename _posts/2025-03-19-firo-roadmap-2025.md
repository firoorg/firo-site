Firo has evolved significantly since its inception as Zcoin, pioneering the use of modern zero-knowledge proofs for privacy. Our technology has matured through steady innovation resulting in influential privacy protocols such as Lelantus and [Lelantus Spark—protocols]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/01/18/spark-is-live.html) whose design and concepts have influenced and been adopted in other privacy projects.

Our [updated roadmap](https://firo.org/about/roadmap/) recognizes the growing maturity of Firo and its tech stack and focuses on **usability**, **utility**, and **upgrades**:
* **Usability**: Enhanced user experience through additional wallet integrations and support for light clients.
* **Utility**: Expand privacy-preserving use cases, including private token issuance.
* **Upgrades**: Continuously refine and strengthen protocol features, maintaining leadership in privacy technology.

# NEAR-TERM
## [Spark Names]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/01/28/spark-names.html)
Allow users to create easy-to-remember, human-readable addresses linked to Spark addresses, enabling convenient sharing and decentralized digital identity

## Spark Coinbase
Enable miners and masternodes to send rewards directly to private Spark addresses, further enhancing user privacy and Spark adoption.

## View Key Tooling
Develop user-friendly methods for sharing and utilizing Spark view keys, enabling watch-only wallets and selectively disclosing Spark-based funds for compliance purposes.

# MID-TERM

## [Spark Assets]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/03/07/spats-confidential-assets-lelantus-spark.html)
Allow users to issue their own privacy-preserving assets. These assets enjoy the same privacy features as Spark, including the ability to hide asset types. All assets (including Firo) contribute to a shared anonymity set, and the protocol can also support privacy-preserving NFTs.

## Spark Swap
Enable atomic swaps between Spark assets and/or Firo, ensuring trustless and private exchanges without using transparent addresses.

## [Curve Trees]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/03/07/curve-trees-research-results.html)
Adopt Curve Trees, an innovative technique for efficient membership proofs that supports a global anonymity set. This upgrade will substantially improve privacy, scalability, verification speed, and proof size.

# LONG-TERM

## Improved Privacy-Preserving Light Wallet Infrastructure
Reduce reliance on customized SPV servers, giving users more private and decentralized light wallet options.

## Quantum-Resistant Spark
Explore paths to transition Spark into a quantum-resistant protocol, as well as potential interim mitigations to safeguard against future quantum threats.

## Tail Emission Consensus Mechanism
Firo’s current hybrid masternode–Proof-of-Work model may evolve once tail emission is reached. We are investigating alternative incentive or consensus mechanisms to secure the chain in the long run.

## Governance
Develop clear, decentralized governance structures to reduce reliance on Firo’s core team. The aim is to align all project stakeholders without focusing solely on coin holdings.

# INTEGRATIONS

## Enkrypt Wallet Integration
Seamless access to Spark privacy directly in [Enkrypt](https://www.enkrypt.com/), a popular Web3 wallet, simplifying secure asset management for users.

## Layerswap v8 Integration
Leverage Layerswap v8, a peer-to-peer protocol for bridging and swapping crypto assets across different blockchains. By using pre-HTLCs, it addresses many limitations of traditional atomic swaps (e.g., both parties needing to be online) and supports multi-hop transactions.

## Serai Integration
Collaborate with [Serai](https://serai.exchange/), a cross-chain DEX focusing on AMM liquidity for Bitcoin, Ethereum, DAI, and Monero. Integrating Firo expands its cross-chain liquidity options and user base.

# ITERATIVE IMPROVEMENTS

## Campfire
Continue building out [Campfire](https://firo.org/2024/07/12/campfire-firo-wallet.html) desktop and mobile wallets to provide full-featured support for masternodes, Spark Assets, and Spark Names.

## FiroDEX
Rework [FiroDEX](https://github.com/firoorg/FiroDEX-Desktop) to be more resilient, ensuring its infrastructure—both nodes and front ends—is operated by a decentralized network of volunteers and community members.

# ONWARDS
Our ongoing development is powered by our passionate community and crucially supported by privacy-aligned partners such as [Power Up Privacy](https://powerupprivacy.com/) and [Arcadia Group](https://arcadia.agency/), who make many of these initiatives possible. We remain committed to decentralization, community-driven growth, and privacy without VC interference. Thank you for your continuous support.
