We are happy to announce that Firo now has a USDT pair on [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/) (both Global and US) allowing US citizens access to Firo via a stablecoin. We are confident this will allow increased utility and liquidity of Firo in the US.

The FIRO/BTC pair in turn will be deprecated after 18 January 2022 to concentrate liquidity on the new FIRO/USDT pair which will be added on 9AM PT, Tuesday, 18 January 2022.

Bittrex was Firoâ€™s (then Zcoin) very first exchange back in 2016 and we look forward to continuing our relationship with one of the longest running exchanges in the space.
