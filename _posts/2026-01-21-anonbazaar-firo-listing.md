We're excited to announce that Firo is now available on [Anonbazaar.com](https://anonbazaar.com/), a peer-to-peer marketplace where users can buy and sell goods and services using privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies. Firo joins Monero as the platform's supported payment options, with full support for Spark addresses.

## What is Anonbazaar?

Anonbazaar is operated by the team behind xmrbazaar.com, one of the most established clear-net marketplaces in the privacy coin ecosystem. Think of it as Craigslist for privacy coins, a straightforward platform where individuals can list and purchase products, services, and rentals directly from one another.

The marketplace covers a wide range of categories including electronics, clothing, food, gift cards, jobs, personal shopping services, and more. Whether you're looking to sell handmade goods, offer freelance services, or find unique items from privacy-conscious sellers, Anonbazaar provides the infrastructure to make it happen.

## Why This Matters

Anonbazaar embodies the principles that make privacy coins valuable in the first place:

**Non-Custodial and P2P:** The platform never holds your funds. All transactions occur directly between buyers and sellers, eliminating counterparty risk and central points of failure.

**No KYC Required:** Users can list items or make purchases without submitting identity documents. This preserves financial privacy while enabling legitimate commerce.

**End-to-End Encrypted Communications:** All private communications between buyers and sellers—including messages, order notes, and shipping details—are secured using PGP encryption. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential and accessible only to the parties involved in a transaction.

**No Listing Fees:** Anonbazaar operates on a donation-based model, removing barriers to entry for sellers who want to accept privacy-preserving payments.

**Reputation System:** Built-in feedback mechanisms help establish trust between trading partners, allowing the community to self-regulate.
Fiat-Pegged Pricing: Sellers can price items in fiat currencies while accepting Firo, making it easier to manage pricing without constant adjustments for market volatility.

## Spark Address Support

Firo listings on Anonbazaar support Spark addresses, meaning all transactions benefit from Lelantus Spark's privacy guarantees. Buyers and sellers can transact with high anonymity sets and no transparent on-chain links between parties.

## Weekly Lucky Draw: $100 in Prizes

To celebrate this listing and encourage adoption, we're partnering with Anonbazaar to run a weekly lucky draw for listings that accept Firo.

**How it works:**

* Each week, two listings that accept Firo will be randomly selected. 
* Each winning listing receives $50 USD worth of Firo. 
* Prizes are sent directly to the Spark address included in the listing. 

If you've been looking for a reason to start accepting Firo for your goods or services, now's a good time to create a listing.

## For Existing XMRBazaar Users
