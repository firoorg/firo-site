We are happy to announce the addition of  80,356.8262 BEP20-FIRO and 167.286754 BNB (~200,000 USD) to the [Pancakeswap pool](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?outputCurrency=0xd5d0322b6bAb6a762C79f8c81A0B674778E13aeD&inputCurrency=0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955) on BNB Chain provided by the generous people at [Power Up Privacy](https://powerupprivacy.com/). This also adds to the existing position that is maintained by the Firo Community Fund bringing the total in the pool of ~224,000 USD at the time of writing. The addition of this liquidity brings much needed depth and usability to the pool.

BEP20-FIRO is a wrapped version of FIRO that is issued and backed 1:1 with native FIRO by Binance. As a BEP20 token on BNB Chain, it does not have privacy features but it allows permissionless access to BNB Chain’s rich DeFi ecosystem such as AMM DEXes and also access to all major stablecoins that are either native to BNB Chain or can be bridged into it

BEP20-FIRO can be swapped to and from native FIRO either through FiroDEX or Komodo Platform, swap providers such as ChangeNow or directly through Binance or MEXC. We’ll be posting more detailed guides on each of these options soon.
