Firo’s Spark addresses have reached a new milestone with WizardSwap becoming the first instant swap provider to support private Spark transactions! This integration brings seamless privacy to cryptocurrency swaps without accounts, signups, or KYC.

With this integration, you can now:

* **Swap to/from Spark addresses** – Send and receive fully private Firo transactions
* **Stay completely anonymous** – WizardSwap requires no registration, accounts, or personal data

This makes private crypto swaps as easy as using a regular exchange – but without sacrificing anonymity.
