We're excited to announce that Firo has been integrated into [SHKeeper](https://shkeeper.io/), the self-hosted and open-source cryptocurrency payment gateway. This integration, [funded through the Firo Community Fund Committee (CFC)](https://funding.firo.org/proposals/firo-integration-with-shkeeper-self-hosted-payment-processor-reuben), marks an important step in making Firo accessible to merchants and businesses worldwide.

## What is SHKeeper?

SHKeeper is a non-custodial cryptocurrency payment processor developed by VSYS Host that allows businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments directly without intermediaries, without third-party fees, and without surrendering control of their funds.

What makes SHKeeper stand out is its commitment to the principles that cryptocurrency was built on. As a self-hosted solution, merchants run the software on their own infrastructure, meaning they retain full custody of their private keys and complete autonomy over their payment processing. There's no KYC required, no middlemen taking a cut, and no dependence on centralized services that could freeze funds or deny service.

SHKeeper also integrates seamlessly with popular e-commerce platforms including WordPress, WooCommerce, WHMCS, and Shopify through ready-made plugins—lowering the barrier for merchants who want to accept crypto without extensive technical knowledge.

## Why This Matters for Firo

This integration addresses one of the most practical questions any cryptocurrency faces: where can people actually spend it?

For Firo, a project built around financial privacy, SHKeeper is a natural fit. Both share a philosophy of minimizing trust and maximizing user control. Importantly, **SHKeeper's Firo integration uses Spark addresses**, meaning payments take full advantage of Lelantus Spark's privacy features. Customers paying with Firo enjoy the protocol's high anonymity sets and the sender privacy that Spark provides, while merchants receive funds directly to their own Spark-enabled wallet.

No custodian ever touches the funds. No payment processor logs the transaction on their servers. The privacy that Firo provides at the protocol level is complemented by infrastructure that respects that privacy at the payment layer.

This integration also makes Firo accessible to a much broader range of businesses. A small online shop running WooCommerce can now accept Firo with minimal setup. Hosting providers using WHMCS can offer Firo as a payment option to privacy-conscious customers. The easier it becomes to accept Firo, the more useful Firo becomes as a medium of exchange—and that utility is what drives sustainable adoption.

## Funded by the Community, for the Community

This integration was made possible through Firo's Community Fund Committee, which oversees the Firo Community Fund—a pool funded by 10% of the block reward specifically designated for community-driven initiatives. The CFC is composed of elected community members who evaluate and approve proposals that benefit the Firo ecosystem.

The SHKeeper integration exemplifies what the Community Fund was designed for: practical improvements that expand Firo's reach and usability, driven by community priorities rather than top-down decisions.

## Getting Started

Merchants interested in accepting Firo through SHKeeper can visit [shkeeper.io](https://shkeeper.io) to learn more about setup and integration options. The software is fully open-source and available on GitHub for those who want to inspect the code or contribute.

For the Firo community, this is another step toward building the infrastructure that makes private digital cash practical for everyday use. We encourage you to spread the word to merchants you know and support businesses that choose to accept Firo.
