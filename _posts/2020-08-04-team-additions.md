We welcome two new developers to [the team,]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/team/) Sproxet and Rustam!

Sproxet is also the founder of [Signal Eleven,](https://signaleleven.dev/) an IT consultancy which focuses on computer security and auditing, software development and cryptographic systems architecture design. 

Rustam is a full stack developer but his passion is on front-end development and is experienced in ReactJS and Angular. He graduated with a degree in Mathematics: Computer Sciences from the Yerevan State University. He also enjoys experimenting with music and audio processing, 3d environments, gaming and virtual reality.
