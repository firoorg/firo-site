We are happy to release a refresh to our QT GUI to be more in line with Firo branding while preserving the familiar layout of the previous QT wallet. The QT wallet will always be the first to receive the latest features and is catered towards more power users or those who want more fine-grained control. This new GUI is available in our latest wallet release v0.14.9.2.

A more modern looking simplified interface is also available via our Electron wallet and is the one we recommend to most users. We are working on bringing RAP address support to the Electron wallet soon!
