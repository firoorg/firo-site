We are excited to join the [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain) DeFi ecosystem with the introduction of BEP-20 FIRO and its support in [Binance Bridge](https://www.binance.org/en/bridge) which provides access to inter-blockchain liquidity. 

_**December 2021: Binance Bridge has been retired. You can convert native FIRO to BEP20 FIRO through [FiroDEX](https://github.com/firoorg/FiroDEX-Desktop/releases/tag/0.5.2-beta) or Binance Exchange**_

Binance Bridge provides a seamless platform where native FIRO can be converted into BEP-20 FIRO or vice versa. You can learn more about Binance Bridge with [this video.](https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/fhip2z4nth)

This also means that native FIRO can be converted and withdrawn to any BSC supported wallet such as Metamask, Trust Wallet or Binance Chain wallet. Binance exchange also allows direct deposits and withdrawals of BEP20 FIRO.

While BEP-20 Firo on BSC does not enjoy the same privacy or decentralization of native FIRO, we at Firo believe in a multi-blockchain cryptocurrency ecosystem where blockchains are interoperable and are used for different purposes. 

We continue to seek out integrations and bridges with other popular chains to increase the utility of FIRO. This integration with BSC also adds to our existing Ethereum DeFi bridge via [Stakehound (stFIRO)](https://stakehound.com/docs/faq/stfiro/) which allows users to hold ERC20 tokens on Ethereum that represent Firo backed by masternodes and auto accrues masternode rewards on top of any other liquidity incentives.

Stay tuned for activities involving BEP20 Firo!
