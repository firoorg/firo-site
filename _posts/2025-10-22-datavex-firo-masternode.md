We’re pleased to share that [DataVEX](https://datavex.eu/), a new masternode hosting provider, has added **Firo** to its list of supported masternodes. You can now easily deploy and manage **Firo masternodes** - no technical skills required. This makes it simple for anyone to participate in securing the Firo network without needing to handle server setups or command-line configurations.

DataVEX now accepts **FIRO** and **Spark** as payment options, aligning with our shared vision of privacy, flexibility, and user empowerment.

## Special Launch Promotion

To celebrate the addition of Firo, [DataVEX is offering one month of free hosting](https://datavex.eu/prices/FIRO/) for a Firo masternode to the **first 10 customers**.

It’s a *first come, first served* opportunity for community members looking to set up their own masternode and contribute to network stability.

## Q&A

**Q: You're a relatively newcomer to the Firo ecosystem, what made you decide to add Firo support?**

At DataVex, we choose projects where we see real potential and concrete use cases. We added FIRO support to help grow the network and make it easier for people who want to run a node but have little or no experience setting one up. Our goal is to lower the barrier to entry—so anyone who wants to support FIRO can do it quickly, safely, and without complex administration.

**Q: What drew you to Firo? Anything that you are particularly excited about?**

Privacy is the headline reason. In both crypto and traditional finance, real-world users need payments that don’t leak business intelligence or personal activity by default. Firo’s focus on practical, on-chain privacy aligns perfectly with that need.

**Q: You had to code your Firo payment gateway from scratch to accept Spark payments, tell us abit about the process.**

We already had a native Firo gateway, but we’re big on privacy—so we added Spark. We wrote the Spark integration from scratch (addresses, detection, confirmations) to keep payments private by default while keeping our checkout simple and self-hosted.

**Q: Anything you would like to see in Firo or its ecosystem?**

What we’ve already started:

* A Spark-first gateway reference (templated, self-hosted) to serve as a BTCPay-style baseline.
* Lightweight SDKs — Python core first (invoices, confirmations), with a small JS client for browser/apps.
* A draft Spark URI/QR convention + webhook/event guidelines.
* WooCommerce plugin MVP (checkout + callbacks); PrestaShop prototype next.
* Merchant docs & examples: quick-starts, invoice flow, troubleshooting.
