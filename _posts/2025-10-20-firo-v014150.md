As this is a **mandatory release**, all users including wallet, node, and masternode operators must update before **block 1,205,100** (approximately **19 November 2025**) to stay in sync with the network and prevent service disruption.

You can download the latest binaries here: [Firo v0.14.15.0 Release on GitHub](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/releases/tag/v0.14.15.0)

## Key Highlights

### Spark Name Transfers

This release introduces **Spark Name Transfers**, enabling users to transfer Spark Names directly between wallets. Spark Names serve as human-readable identifiers for Spark Addresses, making private transactions easier to manage while preserving full privacy. This update extends their flexibility when users want to change their Spark Names ownership to someone else or assign it to a different address. This also allows users to sell their Spark Names creating a more vibrant Spark Name economy. A guide will be published soon.

### GPU memory requirement for FiroPOW

As per the Firo community’s decision, the memory requirement to mine Firo using a GPU will be dropped to ensure that cards with 8GB of VRAM can still continue to mine Firo. The change supports broader accessibility and strengthens network decentralization by lowering the entry barrier for miners while keeping obsolete hardware out.

### Additional Changes

This update also includes **Sigma stripping** which improves load times, increased **Spark Spend limits**, and a **new loading screen** that gives more details on what’s going in the background on startup, among other optimizations and minor improvements.
