FIRO reopens for trading on Binance in 6 European countries

In May 2023, [Binance made Firo and several other privacy coins unavailable in several European countries](https://www.theblock.co/post/232751/binance-privacy-coins-delisting-europe) namely Poland, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Sweden, due to new EU regulations restricting the trading of privacy coins.

In January 2024, [EX-addresses]({{ site.baseurl_root }}2023/11/06/exchange-addresses.html), an address type aimed at centralized exchange use went live on Firoâ€™s mainnet. This address type opened a path for Firo and other privacy coins such as Zcash and PIVX to maintain a Binance listing by meeting the new regulatory requirements while still protecting p2p user privacy. Binance is currently well underway in its process of implementing EX-addresses for FIRO.

With the new address type and other measures taken by Binance, we are pleased to announce that FIRO has been reopened for trading on Binance in all these countries again..

We would like to thank Binance for continuing to support us in navigating these regulatory challenges. Join the discussion and share your experience in the [forums](https://forum.firo.org/t/binance-has-re-enabled-trading-for-firo-in-the-eu/3193)!
