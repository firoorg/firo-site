This is a mandatory update extending emergency switch support for one more year per [community decision](https://forum.firo.org/t/emergency-switch-functionality-for-lelantus-lelantus-spark-to-extend-or-retire/2749).

Please update your software before **block 608035 (approximately January 14th, 4pm UTC)** to avoid any potential issues. Updating after this block will require a reindex.

This release includes several bug fixes, including:

* A fix for the transaction weight limit (issue [#1220](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/pull/1220))
* Various fixes for undefined behaviour (issues [#1198](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/pull/1198), [#1212](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/pull/1212))
* A fix for the UI size in Ubuntu (issue [#1210](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/pull/1210))
* An option to hide/unhide RAP Addresses page manually (issue [#1208](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/pull/1208))

You can download the update from the [Firo website]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-firo/download/).

As usual, please **backup your wallet** prior to updating for safety.

We appreciate your continued support.
