We are excited that [Trezor](https://shop.trezor.io), one of the most established hardware wallets has added Trezor support for both the [Trezor T](https://blog.trezor.io/june-updates-trezor-modelt-firmware-wallet-zcash-cashaddr-doge-6e49e8a7890e) and the [Trezor One](https://blog.trezor.io/june-updates-trezor-one-firmware-wallet-zcash-cashaddr-doge-e21cbdf9807d) into their device firmware. 

We are very grateful for the work of our community member [Yura Pakhuchiy](https://github.com/yura-pakhuchiy), who has tirelessly worked on this and kept in contact with the team at Satoshi Labs to make this possible. 

Zcoin will also be added officially into the web wallet soon but you can already use it to store your Zcoin and even store your Znode collateral using [Znode tool](https://github.com/yura-pakhuchiy/znode-tool/releases), also developed by Yura. 

As Zcoin is among the newly-integrated coins of which Trezor say they "will be gradually surfacing in Trezor Wallet", Zcoin is not visible by default but needs some extra configuration in the wallet. Stay tuned for a full tutorial on how to use Zcoin with Trezor!
