The community has been actively discussing Firo's economics, particularly its block reward division and emission model.

After seeking community feedback and [preliminary polls](https://forum.firo.org/t/poll-final-tokenomics-and-block-division/3379) since June, we are now approaching the penultimate poll to definitively decide Firo’s future.

The two primary issues being voted on are:

* What should Firo’s block reward division be?
* What should Firo’s emissions be?

These polls touch on important issues, such as whether there should be a development and/or community fund, the sustainability of masternodes and the role of miners. It also looks into the long-term sustainability of Firo as to whether it should adopt a tail emission or stick closer to the original Bitcoin model.

Instead of a single-choice vote, the poll allows community members to rank their options, resulting in a fairer reflection of sentiment. This is also known as [ranked-choice voting](https://fairvote.org/our-reforms/ranked-choice-voting/) and is suitable where there are many options to choose from.

You can view the previous discussions and polls here to help guide your decision!

* [Development and Community Funds](https://forum.firo.org/t/poll-should-firo-continue-its-development-fund-and-community-fund/3274)

* [Firo’s halving schedule](https://forum.firo.org/t/poll-should-firo-keep-its-halving-schedule-or-should-we-revisit-our-emission-curve/3276)
