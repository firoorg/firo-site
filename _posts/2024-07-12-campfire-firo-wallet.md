We are proud to release our new revamped Campfire wallet in collaboration with Cypher Stack.

Campfire is a Firo-only wallet with a default on Spark privacy. It features many other Firo-specific enhancements, such as masternode collateral recognition and EX-address support. It also includes inbuilt TOR for additional network privacy. It even works on both desktop and mobile devices!

Like its namesake, Campfire is designed to be a warm, welcoming experience where our Firofam can begin their privacy journey.

## Improved User Experience

Much work has been put into making the wallet user-friendly with Firo colours, and our Sparky mascot is featured prominently.

Under the hood, both teams have made many optimisations to make Spark transactions and syncing speedy and snappy, even with the complex math behind them.

Instead of using the default server, users can choose to host their own light server backend for even more privacy.

## Open source

Campfire remains true to our goals of being free and open source. All source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/firoorg/campfire). 

While the original Campfire started as a Firo wallet that supported our previous privacy protocol, Lelantus, the new revamped Campfire has full Spark privacy support and shares the same internals as Stack wallet, a multi-coin wallet also developed by Cypher Stack.

## What's next?

We would like to develop more features for Campfire, such as DEX support and Spark asset support!

## Special Thanks

We would like to thank Rasikh Morani from Arcadia, who provided the initial funding for Campfire and Cypher Stack, whose development and research services have greatly improved Firo and its technology stack.

We also would like to thank the Firo Community Fund Committee, whose continued support of core team activities has made this possible.
