We’re deeply grateful to announce that [Power Up Privacy](https://powerupprivacy.com/), a long-time supporter of Firo and advocate for privacy rights, has made another generous contribution - **290 XMR**, equivalent to roughly **USD 91,000** as of this blog post, to the Firo’s core team.

This donation will directly support our ongoing development efforts, research into Firo’s privacy technology, and continued education around the importance of financial privacy.

## A Consistent Supporter in Challenging Times

Power Up Privacy has been with us through both progress and challenges, consistently demonstrating belief in Firo’s mission. Their continued backing, even during difficult market periods, has helped us sustain core development, advance privacy research, and keep awareness efforts alive.

We are truly grateful for their ongoing commitment - their support fuels our ability to keep innovating and building tools that defend financial freedom and user sovereignty.

## Acknowledging Our Infrastructure Partners

We would also like to extend our heartfelt thanks to [Cypher Stack](https://cypherstack.com/) for introducing us to Power Up Privacy and using part of their grant to continue maintaining and improving Firo’s infrastructure and Campfire/Stack wallets. Their expertise and reliability ensure that our system remains stable and in working order.

## Moving Forward

With this donation, we’ll continue to strengthen Firo’s foundation, push privacy innovation further, and support the open-source work that benefits not only our project but the broader privacy ecosystem as a whole.

Once again, a huge thank you to **Power Up Privacy**, the **Cypher Stack** team - and to every member of the **Firofam** who believes in and supports our shared vision for a private, decentralized future.
