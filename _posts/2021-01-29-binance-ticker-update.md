* At 2021/01/20 00:00 AM (UTC), Binance will suspend XZC staking purchases. All XZC staked in Binance Staking accounts will be unstaked and automatically deposited into users’ spot accounts. At the same time, XZC staking rewards will be calculated and rewarded based on the amount and time that the XZC was staked up until 2021/01/20 00:00 AM (UTC).

* At 2021/01/20 02:00 AM (UTC), Binance will suspend XZC/USDT and XZC/BTC isolated margin borrowing, as well as XZC loan services.

* At 2021/01/22 02:00 AM (UTC), we will delist XZC/USDT and XZC/BTC isolated margin trading pairs.

* At 2021/01/24 10:00 PM (UTC), we will suspend XZC deposits and withdrawals. Please ensure that you leave sufficient time for your XZC deposits to be fully processed prior to this time.

* At 2021/01/25 02:00 AM (UTC), we will halt trading for all XZC trading pairs, and the trading pairs will also subsequently be delisted from the exchange. We will then take an immediate snapshot of all XZC balances and begin the distribution of FIRO to all eligible users at a ratio of 1 XZC = 1 FIRO.

* At 2021/01/29 02:00 AM (UTC), we will open trading for the new FIRO/BTC, FIRO/USDT, and FIRO/ETH pairs. Staking for FIRO will be available for purchase.
