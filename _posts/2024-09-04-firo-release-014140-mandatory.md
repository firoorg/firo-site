Following the [finalisation of the community polls](https://firo.org/2024/09/01/finalized-tokenomics-2024.html) to determine Firoâ€™s tokenomics, we are releasing Firo v0.14.14.0 with the agreed-upon changes that require a hard fork.

Please upgrade your wallets, daemons and masternodes to the latest Firo v0.14.14.0 before block 958655 (approximately 16 September 2024). **This is a mandatory upgrade**.

You can download them either from our [official download page](https://firo.org/get-firo/download/) or our [Github release page](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/releases).

If you are using Campfire or Stack wallets, no updates are required, as the changes have been made in the backend.
