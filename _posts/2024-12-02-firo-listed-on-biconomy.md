We are thrilled to announce that Firo is now listed on [Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.com/) with a USDT trading pair!

To celebrate this listing, Biconomy is hosting a Kickstarter session where users can commit USDT tokens for a chance to earn airdrop rewards totaling $2,500 in Firo and $1,000 in USDT.

The Biconomy listing supports both native FIRO and BEP20 FIRO networks and most notably also supports direct withdrawal to Spark addresses from the exchange for added privacy making it the 2nd centralized exchange to do so.
