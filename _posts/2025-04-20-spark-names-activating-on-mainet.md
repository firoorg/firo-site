We're thrilled to announce that **Spark Names** will be activated on the Firo mainnet at approximately **block 1,104,500**, expected around **28 May 2025**. To smoothly transition, all users are required to upgrade to **Firo v0.14.14.1**.

## What are Spark Names?

Spark Names simplify Firo addresses by allowing users to register unique, easy-to-remember aliases instead of long cryptographic addresses. This innovation makes sending and receiving FIRO intuitive, convenient, and less prone to error.

## Supporting the Community

Registration fees from Spark Names directly contribute to the **Firo Community Fund**, actively supporting ongoing development, ecosystem growth, and adoption initiatives. Your participation helps sustain and enhance the Firo network.

## How to Prepare

To ensure seamless functionality, please:

* Update your Firo node to **v0.14.14.1** prior to block 1,104,500.
* Look out for updates from **Campfire Wallet** and **Stack Wallet**, both of which are expected to support Spark Names by the activation date or shortly thereafter.
