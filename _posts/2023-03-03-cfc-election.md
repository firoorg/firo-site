As of the end of February, the [Community Fund Committee nomination](https://forum.firo.org/t/cfc-nomination-thread-february-2023/2842) stage has ended!
Here is the list of nominees for the general election of the new CFC! 

### CFC Candidates

Forum / Telegram / Discord

* @devwarrior / @Dev_Warrior / @devwarrior#5709
* @Eagle / @eagleblac / @EagleKARTAL#2419
* @Fiendish / @FiroFiend / @Fiendish#6111 (Reelection)

* @sproxet / @sproxet / @sproxet#5932 (Reelection)

All 7 seats are up for the taking! Out of these 9 nominees, only 7 can be elected! 
I hoped that the Firo community will take their time and carefully consider the options before settling on their voting choices. After our [previous CFC election](https://forum.firo.org/t/firo-community-fund-committee-elections/2509), the seven who were elected were as follows:

* RyanApeFiro
* FiroHero
* Rehrar
* OhGodaGirl
* Sproxet
* RasikhMorani
* Nrsimha

Their terms were for 6 months (which has lasted a little over that), but the new CFC will be elected for a term of 1 year. Thank you all for taking the time to serve the Firo community! Thank you to those who have been nominated and accepted a nomination to do the same! 
There will be a brief informal interview with each of the nominees, the transcripts of which will be made available in the thread for this CFC General Election.
