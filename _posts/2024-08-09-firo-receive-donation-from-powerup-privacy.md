[Power Up Privacy](https://powerupprivacy.com/), an anonymous privacy advocacy group that funds privacy-related research and development, has donated 345 XMR (~50,000 USD) to the Firo Core Team fund to support our development work. 

We would like to thank them for their generous donation in supporting our work and also for making a significant impact on other important privacy-focused tools and projects, such as Monero, Tor, and xrdp.
