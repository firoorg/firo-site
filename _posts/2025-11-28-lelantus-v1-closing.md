As part of Firo’s continued evolution, we are completing the transition from **Lelantus (V1)** to **Lelantus Spark**, our next-generation privacy protocol.

The redemption window for Lelantus (V1) will **close at block 1,223,500 (approximately 20 December 2025)**. After this point, it will no longer be possible to redeem your Lelantus coins.

## Why is this happening?

With the launch of **Lelantus Spark**, users can no longer create new Lelantus mints but instead create Lelantus Spark Mints. Lelantus Spark offers stronger privacy by hiding the **sender, receiver, amounts, and even asset types**, while maintaining a more efficient and flexible design. To fully complete this transition, all Lelantus mints need to be redeemed before the redemption window closes.

## What this means for users

* If you still hold unredeemed Lelantus mints, please redeem them before block 1,223,500.
* After this block, redemption will no longer be possible, and those funds will become inaccessible.
* Moving forward, all privacy transactions will use the **Lelantus Spark** protocol, which provides enhanced anonymity and long-term maintainability.

## How to redeem/migrate

This is only for Users that owns Lelantus V1.0 Coins **before January 18, 2024**. If you hold Firo after January 18, 2024, You do NOT need to do anything.
