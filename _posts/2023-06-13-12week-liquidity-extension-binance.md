## What is Hummingbot? 

Hummingbot Liquidity Mining is a decentralized, community-based market making. It allows anyone (communities, the general market) to participate in market making for a token and contribute to its liquidity and improve the tradability of that token. By participating, users are not only helping to support the token and the project, but through liquidity mining, they are able to earn token rewards based on their trading activity. 

## How Does the Campaign Work? 

During the campaign, users who provide liquidity to the FIRO/BTC & FIRO/BSUD pool on Binance will earn rewards in FIRO. 

## How to Get Started? 

To participate in the campaign, you'll need to set up your wallet on the Hummingbot Miner app. Hummingbot has provided a detailed guide on how to set up the app on their website. Once you've set it up, you can follow the steps to connect it to the Binance exchange and start providing liquidity to the FIRO/BTC or/and FIRO/BSUD pool. 

Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity to earn rewards while actively participating in the Firo community! Whether you're an existing participant or a newcomer, we encourage you to join our liquidity mining campaign and experience the benefits firsthand.
