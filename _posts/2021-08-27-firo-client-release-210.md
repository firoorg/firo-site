We have released [Firo Client **v2.1.0**](https://github.com/firoorg/firo-client/releases/tag/v2.1.0) which is an alternate version of our Firo client that has a clean user friendly interface and an integrated no-KYC Coin Swap feature. For those of you on our older beta versions of Firo Client, this is a mandatory upgrade as it incorporates [Firo **v14.8.0**.](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/releases/tag/v0.14.8.0)

You will also notice that the client actively pushes you to anonymize your FIRO by default.
