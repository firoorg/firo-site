We have released Firo Client **v2.1.0** which is an alternate version of our Firo client that has a clean user friendly interface and an integrated no-KYC Coin Swap feature. For those of you on our older beta versions of Firo Client, this is a mandatory upgrade as it incorporates Firo **v14.8.0**.

You will also notice that the client actively pushes you to anonymize your FIRO by default.

By popular demand, there is also now a dark mode!
