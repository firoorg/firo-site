We’re thrilled to announce that Spark Names have officially activated on Firo’s mainnet! 

This highly anticipated upgrade brings human-readable addresses to Firo’s privacy ecosystem, allowing users to send and receive funds with simple aliases like @sparky—all while maintaining the full anonymity of Lelantus Spark.

## Why This Matters

* **Easier Transactions**: No more copying long, complex addresses.
* **Enhanced Privacy**: Spark Names work seamlessly with Firo’s Spark transactions.
* **Fewer Errors**: Reduce mistakes when sharing payment details.

## How to Get Started

1) Update your QT wallet to the latest version [v0.14.14.1.](https://github.com/firoorg/firo/releases/tag/v0.14.14.1) (Campfire on Android and iOS updates are currently rolling out. Please update to the latest on the PlayStore/AppStore)
2) Register your Spark Name and start using it for private transactions.
