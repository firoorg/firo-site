<h3 id="spark-name-transfers">Spark Name Transfers</h3>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo-v014150/swap-names.jpg" alt="Spark name transfer" /></p>

<p>This release introduces <strong>Spark Name Transfers</strong>, enabling users to transfer Spark Names directly between wallets. Spark Names serve as human-readable identifiers for Spark Addresses, making private transactions easier to manage while preserving full privacy. This update extends their flexibility when users want to change their Spark Names ownership to someone else or assign it to a different address. This also allows users to sell their Spark Names creating a more vibrant Spark Name economy. A guide will be published soon.</p>

<h3 id="gpu-memory-requirement-for-firopow">GPU memory requirement for FiroPOW</h3>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo-v014150/mining-upgrade.jpg" alt="GPU VRAM" /></p>

<p>As per the Firo community’s decision, the memory requirement to mine Firo using a GPU will be dropped to ensure that cards with 8GB of VRAM can still continue to mine Firo. The change supports broader accessibility and strengthens network decentralization by lowering the entry barrier for miners while keeping obsolete hardware out.</p>

<h3 id="additional-changes">Additional Changes</h3>

<p>This update also includes <strong>Sigma stripping</strong> which improves load times, increased <strong>Spark Spend limits</strong>, and a <strong>new loading screen</strong> that gives more details on what’s going in the background on startup, among other optimizations and minor improvements.</p>

<h2 id="looking-back-at-the-past-year">Looking Back at the Past Year</h2>

<p>This past year has been filled with milestones, innovations, and community-driven growth.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo9/sparkname-activated.png" alt="Spark Name" /></p>

<p><strong><a href="/firo-site/pr-preview/pr-527/id/2025/05/28/sparknames-activated.html">Spark Names</a></strong> - One of the most exciting milestones this past year was the launch of Spark Names. This feature makes it easier for users to interact with Firo’s privacy ecosystem by allowing them to register simple, human-readable identifiers instead of relying on long, complex Spark addresses. Much like usernames, Spark Names improve accessibility and usability while still inheriting the full privacy protections of Lelantus Spark. By lowering the barrier for everyday use, Spark Names are helping to bridge the gap between powerful privacy technology and user-friendly digital cash.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo9/pupdonation.png" alt="Power Up Privacy" /></p>

<p><strong><a href="/firo-site/pr-preview/pr-527/id/2025/04/10/firo-receive-574-xmr-donation-power-up-privacy.html">Power Up Privacy donated 574 XMR</a></strong> to the Firo Team to support our mission and is continuing to donate further funds. These funds will go directly towards strengthening Firo’s development, advancing privacy research, and driving awareness initiatives in the broader ecosystem. A heartfelt thank you to Power Up Privacy for believing in our work and contributing to the growth of privacy technologies. It is the commitment of supporters like you, along with the tireless efforts of the Firofam, that keeps us moving forward.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo9/wizardswap-spark.png" alt="WizardSwap Spark Address" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.wizardswap.io/"><strong>WizardSwap</strong></a> became the first swap provider to integrate Spark addresses and also Instant-Send. This means users can now swap privately and almost instantly with WizardSwap, enjoying Firo’s full privacy protections without needing extra steps. We are seeing strong swap volumes primarily people swapping from XMR into FIRO.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo9/confidential-layer.png" alt="confidential layer" /></p>

<p>The partnership with <strong>Confidential Layer</strong>, a non-custodial bridge that enables seamless asset transfers between public blockchains and privacy-preserving blockchains, allows users to move assets securely across chains while retaining the option of privacy when they need it. This is significant because it opens the door to greater interoperability. By connecting Firo’s privacy layer with the broader blockchain ecosystem, this partnership strengthens our vision of making privacy not just a feature, but a standard. It bridges the gap between transparent and private economies, empowering users to choose confidentiality without sacrificing accessibility or usability.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo9/firomonerokon2025.jpg" alt="Firo at Monerokon 2025" /></p>

<p>Firo attended <strong>Monerokon 2025 in Prague</strong>, where we were one of the few privacy projects with a dedicated booth. The reception was overwhelmingly positive, with many attendees from the Monero community recognizing Firo as “one of the legit ones.” It was encouraging to see so much interest at our booth, by far one of the most visited. and we look forward to fostering stronger relationships with the Monero community and beyond.</p>

<p>At <strong>ETHDam III</strong>, we explored how privacy coins like Firo can integrate into mainstream adoption without compromising their core values. The talk addressed common myths around privacy coins and highlighted practical solutions for shaping a more private future.
Watch here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty50kXR--Y8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty50kXR–Y8</a></p>

<p><strong>Biconomy Exchange listed Firo</strong> with support for Spark address withdrawals. This makes Biconomy the second centralized exchange (first being NonKYC.io with full Spark deposits and withdrawal support)  to enable users to withdraw directly to a Spark address, bringing the benefits of Firo’s cutting-edge privacy protocol to a wider audience.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo9/firosyriaoffice.jpg" alt="Syria Firo Office" /></p>

<p>One of the most inspiring milestones this year comes directly from the community. A dedicated member in Syria has begun setting up an <strong>office to educate and onboard people to Firo</strong>, providing hands-on guidance about financial privacy and how to use cryptocurrency in their daily lives. In Syria, citizens are only allowed to withdraw around 500,000 Syrian Pounds (~38 USD) a week from their bank and still face a lot of stigma despite sanctions being lifted. Privacy crypto like Firo provides a practical solution to ease value transfer among ordinary Syrians.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo9/Firosyria.png" alt="Syria Firo adoption" /></p>

<p>Beyond education, <strong>real-world adoption is taking shape on the ground</strong>. In Syria, one of the <strong>largest stores in Homs Governorate, Al Dhahik Commercial Complex</strong> that sells essential goods from solar panels to appliances, a <strong>household appliance store, a pharmacy, and a grocery shop</strong> are now accepting FIRO as payment. These businesses are helping to create a practical ecosystem where everyday needs can be met using private digital cash.</p>

<h2 id="a-community-that-makes-it-possible">A Community That Makes It Possible</h2>

<p>At the heart of Firo’s journey is the community. Whether it’s miners securing the network, masternodes operators, serving on the Community Fund Committee, testing new features, helping newcomers, creating Spark Names, or simply spreading the word, every contribution has strengthened the ecosystem. Firo also wouldn’t be here without the support of our partners, who have worked alongside us to advance privacy technology and adoption. To all who have stayed with us, believed in what we do, and contributed in countless ways, old and new, we thank you deeply.</p>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>

<p>As we move into our 10th year, Firo’s mission remains clear: ensuring financial privacy is accessible to all. The road ahead is filled with exciting developments that will push Firo’s technology and usability even further.</p>

<p>Lelantus Spark remains at the core of Firo’s privacy technology, and we will continue to refine and strengthen it. This means ongoing upgrades for performance, security, and usability, ensuring it remains the gold standard in blockchain privacy.</p>

<p><strong>Spark Assets</strong> - Nearing completion, Spark Assets will allow users to issue their own privacy-preserving assets. These assets inherit the same protections as Lelantus Spark, including the ability to hide asset types ensuring full confidentiality. Importantly, all assets - including FIRO itself - contribute to a shared anonymity set, further strengthening privacy for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Integration into Enkrypt</strong> - a multi-asset Web3 browser extension wallet, with full support for Spark features. This will make it even easier for users to access Firo’s privacy technology without installing or downloading an application.</p>

<p><strong>Curve Trees</strong> - An innovative technique for efficient membership proofs that supports a global anonymity set. This upgrade will substantially improve privacy, scalability, verification speed, and proof size, making Spark even more robust and efficient.</p>

<p>And these are just some of the improvements on the horizon. With community support and ongoing innovation, Firo will continue leading the way in financial privacy while expanding its reach and usability.</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Thank you to every member of the Firofam for being part of this journey. Nine years is a huge milestone in crypto, and it’s only possible because of the strength of this community and the vision we share. Here’s to the next chapter, and to building a future where financial privacy is the norm, not the exception.</p>

FCF funds must always be utilised for the benefit of Firo. Research, development or promotional activities that do not directly benefit Firo should not be undertaken. All FCF expenditure has to be disclosed. Any proposal that does not allow this will not be able to be funded from the FCF. FCF funds should not be used for giveaways even for the purpose of promoting adoption or participation. FCF funds should not be used to host purely social events. Educational or awareness events are acceptable but must be the primary component of the event. FCF funds should be used and while there shouldn’t be a pressure to spend funds, the FCF should not be hoarded. CFC can choose to use the FCF to employ contractors to embark on specific tasks or roles that will report directly to the CFC. Should the CFC deem fit, FCF funds can be burnt by sending it to this burn address. FCF funds address can be viewed here. Where can I see the deliberations of the Community Fund Committee?

<p>The CFC’s work ensures transparency and community-driven stewardship of Firo’s resources. We look forward to your applications!</p>

<p>Below is a reminder of the role of the CFC and the Firo Community Fund (FCF) it manages:</p>

<h2 id="brief-summary-of-how-the-cfc-came-to-be">Brief summary of how the CFC came to be</h2>

<p>Firo conducted a series of community votes to adjust its tokenomics and established the Firo Community Fund. This process spanned several months and involved multiple vetted polls to ensure alignment with the community’s wishes. A committee comprising seven elected community members was established to manage fund allocation.</p>

<p>Following the nomination phase, nominees (who are new) undergo a vetting process, including an interview, to assess their eligibility and alignment with the community’s voting objectives. The interview, which can be conducted through text or online meetings, delves into the nominees’ beliefs in Firo, their grasp of Firo’s technology, personal background (without revealing sensitive information), and their vision for the fund’s utilization. Nominees not widely known in the community must provide proof of active participation for at least a year.</p>

<p>Moving on from these specifics, it’s essential to outline the responsibilities and prerequisites expected of a member of the Firo Community Fund Committee (CFC).</p>

<h2 id="responsibilities-of-community-fund-committee-members">Responsibilities of Community Fund Committee members</h2>

<ol>
  <li>To decide along with taking into account community feedback on how the community fund should be utilized.</li>
  <li>To help evaluate community requests for funding, do due diligence on applicants applying for funding, and obtain all necessary information to ensure sufficient detail for the scope of work.</li>
  <li>To evaluate and approve payment of milestone requests</li>
  <li>To make all reasoning of the CFC for approval/rejection public</li>
  <li>CFC can request for core team’s feedback and opinion on proposals.</li>
  <li>To always conduct themselves with professionalism without resorting to personal attacks or insults.</li>
</ol>

<p>Minimum requirements to be eligible to be a committee member</p>

<ol>
  <li>Be a recognized and active community member of Firo for at least a year, OR a recognized industry expert/specialist.</li>
  <li>Solid understanding of Firo’s technology stack and current roadmap and goals</li>
  <li>Cannot be a current full-time member of the Firo core team. Part-time contributors or contractors of Firo’s core team are allowed but must be disclosed.</li>
  <li>Be able to attend a CFC meeting once a month or appoint a proxy to do the same (though proxies should be used sparingly).</li>
  <li>While a technical or development background isn’t required, having a few committee members with some technical background would be helpful in evaluating proposals.</li>
  <li>Be able to read, check and vote on proposals for funding at least once a week.</li>
  <li>Be 18 years old and above.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="removal-of-cfc-members">Removal of CFC Members</h2>

<ol>
  <li>If a CFC member is suspected or found to have been involved in fraud or scam or other deceitful behavior, the other CFC members can vote to remove them via majority vote.</li>
  <li>If a CFC member has acted in a manner that is an unbecoming or unprofessional manner, the other CFC members can vote to remove them via a majority vote.</li>
  <li>If a CFC member is absent for 2 meetings in a row without due cause, they shall be removed automatically.</li>
  <li>If a CFC member has continuously failed to vote on proposals for funding, a vote shall be held at the next CFC meeting by the other CFC members on whether to remove them.</li>
  <li>If a CFC member is removed, nominations should be open for the spot for the remaining term.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="meetings-quorums-and-voting">Meetings, Quorums, and Voting</h2>

<ol>
  <li>A meeting should be held at least once a month with CFC members. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss proposals or to choose how to allocate the FCF funds or any other matters arising. Given CFC members may be in different time zones, this should be taken into account when determining the time of the meeting and the opportunity to take turns for amenable timing.</li>
  <li>Core team members or their representatives should always be allowed to observe and attend all CFC meetings, but shall not have a vote unless otherwise specified.</li>
  <li>The minutes of these meetings shall always be publicly available.</li>
  <li>The meeting can be conducted by text or online meetings.</li>
  <li>A quorum should be 5 members. Votes are passed using a majority of votes. In the event of an equality of votes, the core team shall have a casting vote.
6Proposals for funding can be approved without the need for a meeting and shall be voted on in the proposal thread itself.</li>
  <li>When voting for or against a proposal for funding, all CFC members are required to state the reasoning behind their choice.
8Anyone can open a proposal for funding, including CFC members.</li>
  <li>If a CFC member is an applicant for funding, the member cannot vote on that proposal. Also, if a CFC member has a close relationship (e.g. family member, best friend, significant other, spouse) with the applicant for funding, the CFC member should disclose the relationship and put it to the other CFC members to decide whether the member should be allowed to vote or choose to abstain voluntarily.</li>
  <li>If the CFC wishes to make funds available to the core team to assist them (for instance to cover a shortfall or to pay for a specific employee to retain them), a higher vote threshold is required, which is 5 members out of 7 instead of the usual majority of votes.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="general-guidelines-to-community-fund-usage">General Guidelines to Community Fund Usage</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Trust needs to be earned. While anyone can propose to be funded from the FCF, the person’s track record needs to be evaluated, the necessary due diligence needs to be taken, and milestone payments adjusted appropriately.</li>
  <li>The CFC can choose to employ contractors to embark on specific tasks, but shall seek community feedback. Where it involves core code, the CFC has to consult the core team.</li>
  <li>The CFC should not be used to host parties or purely social events. Educational or awareness events are okay but should be done with appropriate evidence and not paid upfront.</li>
  <li>The CFC is to be used and while there shouldn’t be pressure to spend the CFC funds, the CFC funds shouldn’t be hoarded.
5CFC funds should always be utilized for the benefit of Firo. Research or development that does not directly benefit Firo should not be undertaken.</li>
  <li>CFC funds should not be used for giveaways, even for the purpose of promoting adoption or participation. These have limited effects.</li>
  <li>All CFC expenditure has to be disclosed. Contractors that prohibit this should not be engaged.</li>
  <li>Should the CFC deem fit, FCF funds can be burnt by sending them to this burn address. (https://explorer.firo.org/address/aFiroBurningAddressDoNotSendrPtjYA)</li>
  <li>FCF funds address can be viewed here which are from time to time anonymized.</li>
  <li>Utilization of CFC funds and proposals can always be viewed on the Firo Community Crowdfunding page under the category of CFC.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-the-cfc-is-not">What the CFC is NOT</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The CFC are NOT representatives of the opinion of the Firo Community. They are only tasked with matters to do with the Community Fund and do not replace the usual process of getting feedback from the general community and core team in implementing large changes.</li>
  <li>The CFC shall not represent itself as core team members or as representatives of the project.</li>

While Binance is giving a grace period until to <strong>16 June 2025</strong> to withdraw your Firo, we encourage our Firo Fam to withdraw and self custody their Firo as soon as possible. Note that Binance from time to time suspends their withdrawals so ensure you do it soon for peace of mind.</p>

<p>We recommend to <a href="https://firo.org/get-firo/download/">use our wallets here.</a></p>

<p>You can also <a href="/guide/exchange-withdrawal-guide.html">refer to our guides to do so here.</a></p>

<p>Binance has informed us that they will continue to honor redemptions of Binance Smart Chain BEP20 Firo to native FIRO 1:1 but it is unclear whether they would allow withdrawal of native FIRO past <strong>16 June 2025.</strong> We recommend converting this by depositing it to Binance and withdrawing it to native FIRO as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Our guides to <a href="/guide/exchange-withdrawal-guide.html#converting-bep20-firo-to-native-firo">convert BEP20 Firo to native Firo are here.</a></p>

<p>Thereafter you can withdraw to your own wallets as per the withdrawal guides above.</p>

<p>If you want to trade Firo and deposit them to other centralized exchanges, note that some exchanges will forfeit your deposits if you directly send from Spark (such as HTX) so ensure you send from a transparent address. Transparent addresses either start with an “a” or “Z” while Spark addresses always start with “sm”.</p>

<p>As always we recommend users to self custody instead and trade and provide liquidity on non custodial platforms like <a href="https://github.com/firoorg/FiroDEX-Desktop/releases/latest">FiroDEX,</a> Bison Wallet and BasicSwapDEX. We will be working on more detailed guides on how to use these platforms soon to be truly self sovereign and private.</p>]]></content><author><name>Reuben Yap</name></author><category term="community" /><category term="news" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trading on Binance for Firo has now been halted.
