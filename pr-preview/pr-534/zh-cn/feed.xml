<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBh8nUTiy_A">Spark Addresses</a> are part of Firo’s Lelantus Spark protocol, allowing transactions that hide the sender, receiver, and amount while remaining fully verifiable. This provides true financial privacy on-chain.</p>

<p><a href="https://sparknames.firo.org/">Spark Names</a> make private transactions easier by replacing long, complex Spark addresses with simple, human-readable identifiers - like usernames for your wallet.

<h2 id="thank-you-to-cedric-crispin">Thank You to Cedric Crispin</h2>

<p>We’d like to extend our gratitude to Cedric Crispin Mining Pool for their continued support of Firo. Their recent integration of Spark Names and Spark Addresses for block reward payouts enables privacy-conscious miners to receive rewards directly into their private Spark addresses.</p>

<p><strong>Q: You’ve been a huge supporter of Firo, running a mining pool for a long time, can you tell us what motivated you to start one up?</strong></p>

<p>I’m a computer nerd and I also graduated in computer science.
Running a mining pool was inevitable in my case since it touches things i love: networking, coding and blockchain.
I also wanted to be a contributor in the blockchain space.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What drew you to Firo? Anything that you are particularly excited about?</strong></p>

<p>FIRO is one the first coins I mined, although it was still called ZCOIN back then.
The project has always been very vocal about its advocacy for POW. The switch from MTP to FIROPOW was the perfect reaffirmation.
So as soon as I found out there was actually a chance for me to be a contributor in term of stratum pool software, I did not hesitate a single moment.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why do you think miners in many PoW coins don’t seem to care about decentralization of hashrate?</strong></p>

<p>It’s a tough question but I think the main reasons simply boil down to greed, lack of ethics and education.
Unfortunately some mining pools are also not ashamed and not afraid when it comes to exploiting those behaviors for their own benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Anything you would like to see in Firo or its ecosystem?</strong></p>

<p>Of course more POW decentralization.
But I would also love to see miners more involved in community topics/debates/contributions.
FIRO has already implemented multiple fascinating and crucial features: Lelantus spark &amp; FIRODEX. So I hope it will continue to create tools which will make the excessive selling pressure just for FIAT less compelling.</p>]]></content><author><name>Augustus Jong</name></author><category term="community" /><category term="news" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re pleased to share that the Cedric Crispin Mining Pool, which added Firo in 2023, now supports Spark Names and Spark Addresses for block reward payouts!

You can now easily deploy and manage <strong>Firo masternodes</strong> - no technical skills required. This makes it simple for anyone to participate in securing the Firo network without needing to handle server setups or command-line configurations.</p>

<p>DataVEX now accepts <strong>FIRO</strong> and <strong>Spark</strong> as payment options, aligning with our shared vision of privacy, flexibility, and user empowerment.</p>

<h2 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h2>

<p><strong>Q: You’re a relatively newcomer to the Firo ecosystem, what made you decide to add Firo support?</strong></p>

<p>At DataVex, we choose projects where we see real potential and concrete use cases. We added FIRO support to help grow the network and make it easier for people who want to run a node but have little or no experience setting one up. Our goal is to lower the barrier to entry—so anyone who wants to support FIRO can do it quickly, safely, and without complex administration.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What drew you to Firo? Anything that you are particularly excited about?</strong></p>

<p>Privacy is the headline reason. In both crypto and traditional finance, real-world users need payments that don’t leak business intelligence or personal activity by default. Firo’s focus on practical, on-chain privacy aligns perfectly with that need.</p>

<p><strong>Q: You had to code your Firo payment gateway from scratch to accept Spark payments, tell us abit about the process.</strong></p>

<p>We already had a native Firo gateway, but we’re big on privacy—so we added Spark. We wrote the Spark integration from scratch (addresses, detection, confirmations) to keep payments private by default while keeping our checkout simple and self-hosted.</p>

<h3 id="spark-name-transfers">Spark Name Transfers</h3>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo-v014150/Swap-Names.png" alt="Spark name transfer" /></p>

<p>This release introduces <strong>Spark Name Transfers</strong>, enabling users to transfer Spark Names directly between wallets. Spark Names serve as human-readable identifiers for Spark Addresses, making private transactions easier to manage while preserving full privacy. This update extends their flexibility when users want to change their Spark Names ownership to someone else or assign it to a different address. This also allows users to sell their Spark Names creating a more vibrant Spark Name economy. A guide will be published soon.</p>

<h3 id="gpu-memory-requirement-for-firopow">GPU memory requirement for FiroPOW</h3>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo-v014150/Mining-Upgrade.png" alt="GPU VRAM" /></p>

<p>As per the Firo community’s decision, the memory requirement to mine Firo using a GPU will be dropped to ensure that cards with 8GB of VRAM can still continue to mine Firo. The change supports broader accessibility and strengthens network decentralization by lowering the entry barrier for miners while keeping obsolete hardware out.</p>

<h3 id="additional-changes">Additional Changes</h3>

<p>This update also includes <strong>Sigma stripping</strong> which improves load times, increased <strong>Spark Spend limits</strong>, and a <strong>new loading screen</strong> that gives more details on what’s going in the background on startup, among other optimizations and minor improvements.</p>

From our early days as Zcoin to becoming Firo, we’ve stayed true to one mission: empowering people with financial privacy and building tools that put control back in their hands.</p>

<h2 id="looking-back-at-the-past-year">Looking Back at the Past Year</h2>

<p>This past year has been filled with milestones, innovations, and community-driven growth.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo9/sparkname-activated.png" alt="Spark Name" /></p>

<p><strong><a href="/firo-site/pr-preview/pr-534/zh-cn/2025/05/28/sparknames-activated.html">Spark Names</a></strong> - One of the most exciting milestones this past year was the launch of Spark Names. This feature makes it easier for users to interact with Firo’s privacy ecosystem by allowing them to register simple, human-readable identifiers instead of relying on long, complex Spark addresses. Much like usernames, Spark Names improve accessibility and usability while still inheriting the full privacy protections of Lelantus Spark. By lowering the barrier for everyday use, Spark Names are helping to bridge the gap between powerful privacy technology and user-friendly digital cash.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo9/pupdonation.png" alt="Power Up Privacy" /></p>

<p><strong><a href="/firo-site/pr-preview/pr-534/zh-cn/2025/04/10/firo-receive-574-xmr-donation-power-up-privacy.html">Power Up Privacy donated 574 XMR</a></strong> to the Firo Team to support our mission and is continuing to donate further funds. These funds will go directly towards strengthening Firo’s development, advancing privacy research, and driving awareness initiatives in the broader ecosystem. A heartfelt thank you to Power Up Privacy for believing in our work and contributing to the growth of privacy technologies. It is the commitment of supporters like you, along with the tireless efforts of the Firofam, that keeps us moving forward.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo9/wizardswap-spark.png" alt="WizardSwap Spark Address" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.wizardswap.io/"><strong>WizardSwap</strong></a> became the first swap provider to integrate Spark addresses and also Instant-Send. This means users can now swap privately and almost instantly with WizardSwap, enjoying Firo’s full privacy protections without needing extra steps. We are seeing strong swap volumes primarily people swapping from XMR into FIRO.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo9/confidential-layer.png" alt="confidential layer" /></p>

<p>The partnership with <strong>Confidential Layer</strong>, a non-custodial bridge that enables seamless asset transfers between public blockchains and privacy-preserving blockchains, allows users to move assets securely across chains while retaining the option of privacy when they need it. This is significant because it opens the door to greater interoperability. By connecting Firo’s privacy layer with the broader blockchain ecosystem, this partnership strengthens our vision of making privacy not just a feature, but a standard. It bridges the gap between transparent and private economies, empowering users to choose confidentiality without sacrificing accessibility or usability.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo9/firomonerokon2025.jpg" alt="Firo at Monerokon 2025" /></p>

<p>Firo attended <strong>Monerokon 2025 in Prague</strong>, where we were one of the few privacy projects with a dedicated booth. The reception was overwhelmingly positive, with many attendees from the Monero community recognizing Firo as “one of the legit ones.” It was encouraging to see so much interest at our booth, by far one of the most visited. and we look forward to fostering stronger relationships with the Monero community and beyond.</p>

<p>At <strong>ETHDam III</strong>, we explored how privacy coins like Firo can integrate into mainstream adoption without compromising their core values. The talk addressed common myths around privacy coins and highlighted practical solutions for shaping a more private future.
Watch here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty50kXR--Y8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty50kXR–Y8</a></p>

<p><strong>Biconomy Exchange listed Firo</strong> with support for Spark address withdrawals. This makes Biconomy the second centralized exchange (first being NonKYC.io with full Spark deposits and withdrawal support)  to enable users to withdraw directly to a Spark address, bringing the benefits of Firo’s cutting-edge privacy protocol to a wider audience.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo9/firosyriaoffice.jpg" alt="Syria Firo Office" /></p>

<p>One of the most inspiring milestones this year comes directly from the community. A dedicated member in Syria has begun setting up an <strong>office to educate and onboard people to Firo</strong>, providing hands-on guidance about financial privacy and how to use cryptocurrency in their daily lives. In Syria, citizens are only allowed to withdraw around 500,000 Syrian Pounds (~38 USD) a week from their bank and still face a lot of stigma despite sanctions being lifted. Privacy crypto like Firo provides a practical solution to ease value transfer among ordinary Syrians.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo9/Firosyria.png" alt="Syria Firo adoption" /></p>

<p>Beyond education, <strong>real-world adoption is taking shape on the ground</strong>. In Syria, one of the <strong>largest stores in Homs Governorate, Al Dhahik Commercial Complex</strong> that sells essential goods from solar panels to appliances, a <strong>household appliance store, a pharmacy, and a grocery shop</strong> are now accepting FIRO as payment. These businesses are helping to create a practical ecosystem where everyday needs can be met using private digital cash.</p>

<h2 id="a-community-that-makes-it-possible">A Community That Makes It Possible</h2>

<p>At the heart of Firo’s journey is the community. Whether it’s miners securing the network, masternodes operators, serving on the Community Fund Committee, testing new features, helping newcomers, creating Spark Names, or simply spreading the word, every contribution has strengthened the ecosystem. Firo also wouldn’t be here without the support of our partners, who have worked alongside us to advance privacy technology and adoption. To all who have stayed with us, believed in what we do, and contributed in countless ways, old and new, we thank you deeply.</p>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>

<p>As we move into our 10th year, Firo’s mission remains clear: ensuring financial privacy is accessible to all. The road ahead is filled with exciting developments that will push Firo’s technology and usability even further.</p>

<p>Lelantus Spark remains at the core of Firo’s privacy technology, and we will continue to refine and strengthen it. This means ongoing upgrades for performance, security, and usability, ensuring it remains the gold standard in blockchain privacy.</p>

<p>Thank you to every member of the Firofam for being part of this journey. Nine years is a huge milestone in crypto, and it’s only possible because of the strength of this community and the vision we share.

<p>Happy 9th Birthday, Firo!</p>]]></content><author><name>Augustus Jong</name></author><category term="community" /><category term="news" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Firo turns 9 years old, we’re not just celebrating a birthday, we’re celebrating the dedication of the community, the resilience of the project, and the progress we’ve made together. From our early days as Zcoin to becoming Firo, we’ve stayed true to one mission: empowering people with financial privacy and building tools that put control back in their hands. Looking Back at the Past Year This past year has been filled with milestones, innovations, and community-driven growth. Spark Names - One of the most exciting milestones this past year was the launch of Spark Names. This feature makes it easier for users to interact with Firo’s privacy ecosystem by allowing them to register simple, human-readable identifiers instead of relying on long, complex Spark addresses. Much like usernames, Spark Names improve accessibility and usability while still inheriting the full privacy protections of Lelantus Spark. By lowering the barrier for everyday use, Spark Names are helping to bridge the gap between powerful privacy technology and user-friendly digital cash. Power Up Privacy donated 574 XMR to the Firo Team to support our mission and is continuing to donate further funds. These funds will go directly towards strengthening Firo’s development, advancing privacy research, and driving awareness initiatives in the broader ecosystem. A heartfelt thank you to Power Up Privacy for believing in our work and contributing to the growth of privacy technologies. It is the commitment of supporters like you, along with the tireless efforts of the Firofam, that keeps us moving forward. WizardSwap became the first swap provider to integrate Spark addresses and also Instant-Send. This means users can now swap privately and almost instantly with WizardSwap, enjoying Firo’s full privacy protections without needing extra steps. We are seeing strong swap volumes primarily people swapping from XMR into FIRO. The partnership with Confidential Layer, a non-custodial bridge that enables seamless asset transfers between public blockchains and privacy-preserving blockchains, allows users to move assets securely across chains while retaining the option of privacy when they need it. This is significant because it opens the door to greater interoperability. By connecting Firo’s privacy layer with the broader blockchain ecosystem, this partnership strengthens our vision of making privacy not just a feature, but a standard. It bridges the gap between transparent and private economies, empowering users to choose confidentiality without sacrificing accessibility or usability. Firo attended Monerokon 2025 in Prague, where we were one of the few privacy projects with a dedicated booth. The reception was overwhelmingly positive, with many attendees from the Monero community recognizing Firo as “one of the legit ones.” It was encouraging to see so much interest at our booth, by far one of the most visited. and we look forward to fostering stronger relationships with the Monero community and beyond. At ETHDam III, we explored how privacy coins like Firo can integrate into mainstream adoption without compromising their core values. The talk addressed common myths around privacy coins and highlighted practical solutions for shaping a more private future. Watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty50kXR–Y8 Biconomy Exchange listed Firo with support for Spark address withdrawals. This makes Biconomy the second centralized exchange (first being NonKYC.io with full Spark deposits and withdrawal support) to enable users to withdraw directly to a Spark address, bringing the benefits of Firo’s cutting-edge privacy protocol to a wider audience. One of the most inspiring milestones this year comes directly from the community. A dedicated member in Syria has begun setting up an office to educate and onboard people to Firo, providing hands-on guidance about financial privacy and how to use cryptocurrency in their daily lives. In Syria, citizens are only allowed to withdraw around 500,000 Syrian Pounds (~38 USD) a week from their bank and still face a lot of stigma despite sanctions being lifted. Privacy crypto like Firo provides a practical solution to ease value transfer among ordinary Syrians. Beyond education, real-world adoption is taking shape on the ground. In Syria, one of the largest stores in Homs Governorate, Al Dhahik Commercial Complex that sells essential goods from solar panels to appliances, a household appliance store, a pharmacy, and a grocery shop are now accepting FIRO as payment. These businesses are helping to create a practical ecosystem where everyday needs can be met using private digital cash. A Community That Makes It Possible At the heart of Firo’s journey is the community. Whether it’s miners securing the network, masternodes operators, serving on the Community Fund Committee, testing new features, helping newcomers, creating Spark Names, or simply spreading the word, every contribution has strengthened the ecosystem. Firo also wouldn’t be here without the support of our partners, who have worked alongside us to advance privacy technology and adoption. To all who have stayed with us, believed in what we do, and contributed in countless ways, old and new, we thank you deeply. Looking Forward As we move into our 10th year, Firo’s mission remains clear: ensuring financial privacy is accessible to all. The road ahead is filled with exciting developments that will push Firo’s technology and usability even further. Lelantus Spark remains at the core of Firo’s privacy technology, and we will continue to refine and strengthen it. This means ongoing upgrades for performance, security, and usability, ensuring it remains the gold standard in blockchain privacy. Spark Assets - Nearing completion, Spark Assets will allow users to issue their own privacy-preserving assets. These assets inherit the same protections as Lelantus Spark, including the ability to hide asset types ensuring full confidentiality. Importantly, all assets - including FIRO itself - contribute to a shared anonymity set, further strengthening privacy for everyone. Integration into Enkrypt - a multi-asset Web3 browser extension wallet, with full support for Spark features. This will make it even easier for users to access Firo’s privacy technology without installing or downloading an application. Curve Trees - An innovative technique for efficient membership proofs that supports a global anonymity set. This upgrade will substantially improve privacy, scalability, verification speed, and proof size, making Spark even more robust and efficient. And these are just some of the improvements on the horizon. With community support and ongoing innovation, Firo will continue leading the way in financial privacy while expanding its reach and usability. Closing Thoughts Thank you to every member of the Firofam for being part of this journey. Nine years is a huge milestone in crypto, and it’s only possible because of the strength of this community and the vision we share. Here’s to the next chapter, and to building a future where financial privacy is the norm, not the exception. Happy 9th Birthday, Firo!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The 4th term of CFC members are formed!</title><link href="https://firo.org/firo-site/pr-preview/pr-534/2025/09/07/4th-term-cfc-members-formed.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The 4th term of CFC members are formed!" /><published>2025-09-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://firo.org/firo-site/pr-preview/pr-534/2025/09/07/4th-term-cfc-members-formed</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://firo.org/firo-site/pr-preview/pr-534/2025/09/07/4th-term-cfc-members-formed.html"><![CDATA[<p>The 7 member Community Fund Committee (“CFC”) is formed to oversee the Firo Community Fund (“FCF”) has been completed!</p>

<p>Below is a reminder of the role of the CFC and the Firo Community Fund (FCF) it manages:</p>

<h2 id="brief-summary-of-how-the-cfc-came-to-be">Brief summary of how the CFC came to be</h2>

<p>Firo conducted a series of community votes to adjust its tokenomics and established the Firo Community Fund. This process spanned several months and involved multiple vetted polls to ensure alignment with the community’s wishes. A committee comprising seven elected community members was established to manage fund allocation.</p>

<p>Following the nomination phase, nominees (who are new) undergo a vetting process, including an interview, to assess their eligibility and alignment with the community’s voting objectives. The interview, which can be conducted through text or online meetings, delves into the nominees’ beliefs in Firo, their grasp of Firo’s technology, personal background (without revealing sensitive information), and their vision for the fund’s utilization. Nominees not widely known in the community must provide proof of active participation for at least a year.</p>

<p>Moving on from these specifics, it’s essential to outline the responsibilities and prerequisites expected of a member of the Firo Community Fund Committee (CFC).</p>

  <li>While a technical or development background isn’t required, having a few committee members with some technical background would be helpful in evaluating proposals.</li>
  <li>Be able to read, check and vote on proposals for funding at least once a week.</li>
  <li>Be 18 years old and above.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="removal-of-cfc-members">Removal of CFC Members</h2>
