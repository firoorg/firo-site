Firo joins Monero as the platform’s supported payment options, with full support for Spark addresses.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-anonbazaar">What is Anonbazaar?</h2>

<p>Anonbazaar is operated by the team behind xmrbazaar.com, one of the most established clear-net marketplaces in the privacy coin ecosystem. Think of it as Craigslist for privacy coins, a straightforward platform where individuals can list and purchase products, services, and rentals directly from one another.</p>

<p>The marketplace covers a wide range of categories including electronics, clothing, food, gift cards, jobs, personal shopping services, and more. Whether you’re looking to sell handmade goods, offer freelance services, or find unique items from privacy-conscious sellers, Anonbazaar provides the infrastructure to make it happen.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Anonbazaar embodies the principles that make privacy coins valuable in the first place:</p>

<p><strong>Non-Custodial and P2P:</strong> The platform never holds your funds. All transactions occur directly between buyers and sellers, eliminating counterparty risk and central points of failure.</p>

<p><strong>No KYC Required:</strong> Users can list items or make purchases without submitting identity documents. This preserves financial privacy while enabling legitimate commerce.</p>

<p><strong>End-to-End Encrypted Communications:</strong> All private communications between buyers and sellers—including messages, order notes, and shipping details—are secured using PGP encryption. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential and accessible only to the parties involved in a transaction.</p>

<p><strong>No Listing Fees:</strong> Anonbazaar operates on a donation-based model, removing barriers to entry for sellers who want to accept privacy-preserving payments.</p>

<p><strong>Reputation System:</strong> Built-in feedback mechanisms help establish trust between trading partners, allowing the community to self-regulate.
Fiat-Pegged Pricing: Sellers can price items in fiat currencies while accepting Firo, making it easier to manage pricing without constant adjustments for market volatility.</p>

<h2 id="spark-address-support">Spark Address Support</h2>

<p>Firo listings on Anonbazaar support Spark addresses, meaning all transactions benefit from Lelantus Spark’s privacy guarantees. Buyers and sellers can transact with high anonymity sets and no transparent on-chain links between parties.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-lucky-draw-100-in-prizes">Weekly Lucky Draw: $100 in Prizes</h2>

<p>To celebrate this listing and encourage adoption, we’re partnering with Anonbazaar to run a weekly lucky draw for listings that accept Firo.</p>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Each week, two listings that accept Firo will be randomly selected.</li>
  <li>Each winning listing receives $50 USD worth of Firo.</li>
  <li>Prizes are sent directly to the Spark address included in the listing.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve been looking for a reason to start accepting Firo for your goods or services, now’s a good time to create a listing.</p>

<h2 id="for-existing-xmrbazaar-users">For Existing XMRBazaar Users</h2>

<p>Already have a listing on XMRBazaar? Adding Firo as an additional payment option takes just a minute. Head over to <a href="https://anonbazaar.com">Anonbazaar.com</a>, edit your listing, and under Payment Method select “Altcoins (Direct Payment in FIRO).”</p>

<p>Enter your Spark address and you’re done. Your listing will now accept both Monero and Firo, giving buyers more flexibility while expanding your potential customer base. Also it puts you in the running for the weekly lucky draw!</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/anonbazaar-firo/payment.png" alt="Payment Methods" /></p>

<p>If you need a wallet that supports Spark addresses, we recommend <a href="https://stackwallet.com/">Stack Wallet</a>, which is open source, supports both Monero and Firo and works on both mobile and desktop.</p>

<p>Through this integration, Firo will become accessible on Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Cardano. Integrations to Base and other prominent EVMs are also in the works. Home to billions of dollars in decentralized exchange liquidity and a thriving landscape of DeFi applications all without relying on centralized intermediaries.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Over the past few years, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies have faced an increasingly hostile environment on centralized exchanges. Regulatory pressure and compliance concerns have led to widespread delistings, restricting access for users who simply want to transact with financial privacy.</p>

<p>This reality underscores a fundamental lesson: relying on centralized gatekeepers is incompatible with the ethos of censorship-resistant money. If a privacy coin can be removed from circulation with a policy decision, its utility as permissionless currency is compromised at the infrastructure level.</p>

<p>Cross-chain bridges offer a path forward. By enabling Firo to be represented on decentralized exchanges across multiple ecosystems, we reduce dependence on any single point of failure. Users can acquire, hold, and trade Firo through permissionless protocols that no centralized entity can unilaterally shut down.</p>

<h2 id="why-rosen-bridge">Why Rosen Bridge</h2>

<p>Rosen Bridge stands out for several reasons that align with Firo’s values:</p>

<p><strong>Decentralized architecture.</strong> Rosen employs a two-layer security model consisting of Watchers (who monitor and report cross-chain events) and Guards (who verify and execute transactions). Both layers require economic collateral and operate under multi-signature constraints, meaning no single entity controls the bridge.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-layered verification.</strong> Each Watcher observes the network independently rather than relying on other Watchers’ reports, preventing fault cascades. A finalized report only proceeds if enough distinct Watchers confirm the same event. Guards then independently verify these reports before processing, and transactions require signatures from a quorum of Guards. So no small group of compromised actors can generate arbitrary transactions.</p>

<p><strong>Skin in the game.</strong> Both Watchers and Guards must lock collateral (RSN and ERG tokens) to participate. Malicious behaviour results in slashed funds, creating strong economic disincentives against misconduct.</p>

<p><strong>Open source and auditable.</strong> All Rosen Bridge code is <a href="https://github.com/rosen-bridge">publicly accessible</a> for review. Every bridge event is tracked on the Ergo blockchain, creating a transparent audit trail.</p>

<p><strong>Scalable design.</strong> Rosen’s modular architecture allows new chains to be integrated through independent, chain-specific modules, positioning this partnership for expansion as additional ecosystems become relevant.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-means-for-firo-users">What This Means for Firo Users</h2>

<p>Once the integration is live, Firo holders will be able to bridge their assets to Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Cardano, gaining access to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deep liquidity on established DEXes like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Cardano-native exchanges.</li>
  <li>Participation in DeFi protocols including lending, liquidity provision, and yield generation.</li>
  <li>A censorship-resistant on-ramp and off-ramp that operates independently of centralized exchange policies.</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn’t about chasing DeFi trends. It’s about building resilient infrastructure. When centralized access points fail, decentralized alternatives must exist. Rosen Bridge provides exactly that.</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>This partnership represents a strategic step in ensuring Firo remains accessible and liquid regardless of the regulatory climate surrounding privacy technologies. We believe that financial privacy is a fundamental right, and that belief must be backed by infrastructure that cannot be switched off.</p>

<p>We’ll share further details on the integration timeline but development is already underway and progressing quickly.
We have also secured commitments from Firo holders to bridge meaningful amounts of Firo once the bridge is live ensuring strong bootstrapped liquidity upon launch.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can learn more about Rosen Bridge at <a href="https://rosen.tech/">rosen.tech</a> and follow our official channels for updates.</p>

This integration, <a href="https://funding.firo.org/proposals/firo-integration-with-shkeeper-self-hosted-payment-processor-reuben">funded through the Firo Community Fund Committee (CFC)</a>, marks an important step in making Firo accessible to merchants and businesses worldwide.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-shkeeper">What is SHKeeper?</h2>

<p>SHKeeper is a non-custodial cryptocurrency payment processor developed by VSYS Host that allows businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments directly without intermediaries, without third-party fees, and without surrendering control of their funds.</p>

<p>What makes SHKeeper stand out is its commitment to the principles that cryptocurrency was built on. As a self-hosted solution, merchants run the software on their own infrastructure, meaning they retain full custody of their private keys and complete autonomy over their payment processing. There’s no KYC required, no middlemen taking a cut, and no dependence on centralized services that could freeze funds or deny service.</p>

<p>SHKeeper also integrates seamlessly with popular e-commerce platforms including WordPress, WooCommerce, WHMCS, and Shopify through ready-made plugins lowering the barrier for merchants who want to accept crypto without extensive technical knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-matters-for-firo">Why This Matters for Firo</h2>

<p>This integration addresses one of the most practical questions any cryptocurrency faces: where can people actually spend it?</p>

<p>For Firo, a project built around financial privacy, SHKeeper is a natural fit. Both share a philosophy of minimizing trust and maximizing user control. Importantly, <strong>SHKeeper’s Firo integration uses Spark addresses</strong>, meaning payments take full advantage of Lelantus Spark’s privacy features. Customers paying with Firo enjoy the protocol’s high anonymity sets and the sender privacy that Spark provides, while merchants receive funds directly to their own Spark-enabled wallet.</p>

<p>No custodian ever touches the funds. No payment processor logs the transaction on their servers. The privacy that Firo provides at the protocol level is complemented by infrastructure that respects that privacy at the payment layer.</p>

<p>This integration also makes Firo accessible to a much broader range of businesses. A small online shop running WooCommerce can now accept Firo with minimal setup. Hosting providers using WHMCS can offer Firo as a payment option to privacy-conscious customers. The easier it becomes to accept Firo, the more useful Firo becomes as a medium of exchange and that utility is what drives sustainable adoption.</p>

<h2 id="funded-by-the-community-for-the-community">Funded by the Community, for the Community</h2>

<p>This integration was made possible through Firo’s Community Fund Committee, which oversees the Firo Community Fund, a pool funded by 10% of the block reward specifically designated for community-driven initiatives. The CFC is composed of elected community members who evaluate and approve proposals that benefit the Firo ecosystem.</p>

<p>The SHKeeper integration exemplifies what the Community Fund was designed for: practical improvements that expand Firo’s reach and usability, driven by community priorities rather than top-down decisions.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Merchants interested in accepting Firo through SHKeeper can visit <a href="https://shkeeper.io">shkeeper.io</a> to learn more about setup and integration options. The software is fully open-source and available on GitHub for those who want to inspect the code or contribute.</p>

<p>For the Firo community, this is another step toward building the infrastructure that makes private digital cash practical for everyday use. We encourage you to spread the word to merchants you know and support businesses that choose to accept Firo.</p>

The redemption window for Lelantus (V1) will close at block 1,223,500 (approximately 20 December 2025). After this point, it will no longer be possible to redeem your Lelantus coins. Why is this happening? With the launch of Lelantus Spark, users can no longer create new Lelantus mints but instead create Lelantus Spark Mints. Lelantus Spark offers stronger privacy by hiding the sender, receiver, amounts, and even asset types, while maintaining a more efficient and flexible design. To fully complete this transition, all Lelantus mints need to be redeemed before the redemption window closes. What this means for users If you still hold unredeemed Lelantus mints, please redeem them before block 1,223,500. After this block, redemption will no longer be possible, and those funds will become inaccessible.

<p><a href="https://sparknames.firo.org/">Spark Names</a> make private transactions easier by replacing long, complex Spark addresses with simple, human-readable identifiers - like usernames for your wallet.

<h2 id="thank-you-to-cedric-crispin">Thank You to Cedric Crispin</h2>

<p>We’d like to extend our gratitude to Cedric Crispin Mining Pool for their continued support of Firo. Their recent integration of Spark Names and Spark Addresses for block reward payouts enables privacy-conscious miners to receive rewards directly into their private Spark addresses.</p>

<p><strong>Q: You’ve been a huge supporter of Firo, running a mining pool for a long time, can you tell us what motivated you to start one up?</strong></p>

<p>I’m a computer nerd and I also graduated in computer science.
Running a mining pool was inevitable in my case since it touches things i love: networking, coding and blockchain.
I also wanted to be a contributor in the blockchain space.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What drew you to Firo? Anything that you are particularly excited about?</strong></p>

<p>FIRO is one the first coins I mined, although it was still called ZCOIN back then.
The project has always been very vocal about its advocacy for POW. The switch from MTP to FIROPOW was the perfect reaffirmation.
So as soon as I found out there was actually a chance for me to be a contributor in term of stratum pool software, I did not hesitate a single moment.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why do you think miners in many PoW coins don’t seem to care about decentralization of hashrate?</strong></p>

<p>It’s a tough question but I think the main reasons simply boil down to greed, lack of ethics and education.
Unfortunately some mining pools are also not ashamed and not afraid when it comes to exploiting those behaviors for their own benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Anything you would like to see in Firo or its ecosystem?</strong></p>

<p>Of course more POW decentralization.
But I would also love to see miners more involved in community topics/debates/contributions.
FIRO has already implemented multiple fascinating and crucial features: Lelantus spark &amp; FIRODEX. So I hope it will continue to create tools which will make the excessive selling pressure just for FIAT less compelling.</p>]]></content><author><name>Augustus Jong</name></author><category term="community" /><category term="news" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re pleased to share that the Cedric Crispin Mining Pool, which added Firo in 2023, now supports Spark Names and Spark Addresses for block reward payouts!

You can now easily deploy and manage <strong>Firo masternodes</strong> - no technical skills required. This makes it simple for anyone to participate in securing the Firo network without needing to handle server setups or command-line configurations.</p>

<p>DataVEX now accepts <strong>FIRO</strong> and <strong>Spark</strong> as payment options, aligning with our shared vision of privacy, flexibility, and user empowerment.</p>

<h2 id="special-launch-promotion">Special Launch Promotion</h2>

<p>To celebrate the addition of Firo, <a href="https://datavex.eu/prices/FIRO/">DataVEX is offering one month of free hosting</a> for a Firo masternode to the <strong>first 10 customers</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s a <em>first come, first served</em> opportunity for community members looking to set up their own masternode and contribute to network stability.</p>

<h2 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h2>

<p><strong>Q: You’re a relatively newcomer to the Firo ecosystem, what made you decide to add Firo support?</strong></p>

<p>At DataVex, we choose projects where we see real potential and concrete use cases. We added FIRO support to help grow the network and make it easier for people who want to run a node but have little or no experience setting one up. Our goal is to lower the barrier to entry—so anyone who wants to support FIRO can do it quickly, safely, and without complex administration.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What drew you to Firo? Anything that you are particularly excited about?</strong></p>

<p>Privacy is the headline reason. In both crypto and traditional finance, real-world users need payments that don’t leak business intelligence or personal activity by default. Firo’s focus on practical, on-chain privacy aligns perfectly with that need.</p>

<p><strong>Q: You had to code your Firo payment gateway from scratch to accept Spark payments, tell us abit about the process.</strong></p>

<p>We already had a native Firo gateway, but we’re big on privacy—so we added Spark. We wrote the Spark integration from scratch (addresses, detection, confirmations) to keep payments private by default while keeping our checkout simple and self-hosted.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Anything you would like to see in Firo or its ecosystem?</strong></p>

<p>What we’ve already started:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Spark-first gateway reference (templated, self-hosted) to serve as a BTCPay-style baseline.</li>
  <li>Lightweight SDKs — Python core first (invoices, confirmations), with a small JS client for browser/apps.</li>
  <li>A draft Spark URI/QR convention + webhook/event guidelines.</li>

<h3 id="spark-name-transfers">Spark Name Transfers</h3>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo-v014150/Swap-Names.png" alt="Spark name transfer" /></p>

<p>This release introduces <strong>Spark Name Transfers</strong>, enabling users to transfer Spark Names directly between wallets. Spark Names serve as human-readable identifiers for Spark Addresses, making private transactions easier to manage while preserving full privacy. This update extends their flexibility when users want to change their Spark Names ownership to someone else or assign it to a different address. This also allows users to sell their Spark Names creating a more vibrant Spark Name economy. A guide will be published soon.</p>

<h3 id="gpu-memory-requirement-for-firopow">GPU memory requirement for FiroPOW</h3>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/firo-v014150/Mining-Upgrade.png" alt="GPU VRAM" /></p>

<p>As per the Firo community’s decision, the memory requirement to mine Firo using a GPU will be dropped to ensure that cards with 8GB of VRAM can still continue to mine Firo. The change supports broader accessibility and strengthens network decentralization by lowering the entry barrier for miners while keeping obsolete hardware out.</p>

<h3 id="additional-changes">Additional Changes</h3>
