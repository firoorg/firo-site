## Connecting Metamask to Binance Smart Chain

Before starting, you will need a wallet that works with the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network.

## Adding BEP20 FIRO support to your Metamask wallet

1. Open your Metamask wallet and click on 'Add Token'.

2. In the next screen, choose 'Custom Token'. 

3. In the 'Token Contract Address', enter the following:

```
0xd5d0322b6bab6a762c79f8c81a0b674778e13aed
```

{:start="4"}
4. If you correctly setup your wallet with BSC in the first step, the 'Token Symbol' will be automatically filled with 'FIRO'. Click next.

5. Click the Add Tokens button.

## Converting FIRO to BEP20 FIRO

There are two ways to convert FIRO to BEP20 FIRO: FiroDEX and Binance Exchange. Converting through Binance Exchange requires a Binance account. No account is required for converting through FiroDEX.
