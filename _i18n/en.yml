tech:
  heading: Research
  heading1: Privacy is about staying one step ahead. The team behind Firo is responsible for some of the most significant blockchain privacy protocols on record, and all that tech is distilled into Firo.
  academicpapers: Academic Papers
  audits: Audits
  sparklelantus1: Lelantus Spark Technology
  sparklelantus2: Lelantus Spark greatly improves over its predecessor Lelantus with flexible Spark addresses that hide all transaction amounts, are not searchable on the blockchain while allowing efficient threshold signatures and both incoming and outgoing view key support. Spark also has a modular structure allowing components to be upgraded as better technology arises while simplifying security analysis. It retains the benefits of Lelantus with no trusted setup, an easy to understand construction and based on well established cryptographic assumptions.
  lelantus1: Lelantus Technology
  lelantus2: Lelantus is a next-generation privacy protocol developed by Aram Jivanyan at Firo. Lelantus allows you to burn your coins, which hides them in an anonymity set of over 65,000. The receiver can redeem it from this anonymity pool, which breaks the links from your transaction and all the previous ones it has been through.
  sigma1: Sigma Technology
  sigma2: We believe the whole purpose of blockchain is to build systems that do not require trust, and that same principle applies to our privacy system itself. This is why we built Sigma for Zcoin in 2018. Sigma uses 256 bit ECC curves for proof sizes of just 1.5 kB - a 17x improvement on then-current technology. Sigma was a precursor to Lelantus, and set many stepping stones to get us where we are today.
  dandelion1: Dandelion Technology
  dandelion2: Dandelion++ protects your IP address. Before Firo transactions are broadcast to the whole network, they’re shuffled between nodes a random number of steps. This way, the origin of the broadcast is decorrelated from your IP address.
  mtp1: Decentralized and fair security
  mtp2: Firo’s Merkle Tree Proof (MTP) mining algorithm further strengthens the practical anonymity of transactions. MTP is memory-intensive, preventing miner centralization. Nodes, however, can bypass this memory requirement. A Zcoin-sponsored audit in 2017 proved the effectiveness of this two-pronged approach.
