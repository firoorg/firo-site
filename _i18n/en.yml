tech:
  heading: Research
  heading1: Privacy is about staying one step ahead. The team behind Firo is responsible for some of the most significant blockchain privacy protocols on record, and all that tech is distilled into Firo.

  lelantus1: Lelantus Technology
  lelantus2: Lelantus is a next-generation privacy protocol developed by Aram Jivanyan at Firo. Lelantus allows you to burn your coins, which hides them in an anonymity set of over 65,000. The receiver can redeem it from this anonymity pool, which breaks the links from your transaction and all the previous ones it has been through.
  sigma1: Sigma Technology
  sigma2: We believe the whole purpose of blockchain is to build systems that do not require trust, and that same principle applies to our privacy system itself. This is why we built Sigma for Zcoin in 2018. Sigma uses 256 bit ECC curves for proof sizes of just 1.5 kB - a 17x improvement on then-current technology. Sigma was a precursor to Lelantus, and set many stepping stones to get us where we are today.
  dandelion1: Dandelion Technology
  dandelion2: Dandelion++ protects your IP address. Before Firo transactions are broadcast to the whole network, they’re shuffled between nodes a random number of steps. This way, the origin of the broadcast is decorrelated from your IP address.
  mtp1: Decentralized and fair security
  mtp2: Firo’s Merkle Tree Proof (MTP) mining algorithm further strengthens the practical anonymity of transactions. MTP is memory-intensive, preventing miner centralization. Nodes, however, can bypass this memory requirement. A Zcoin-sponsored audit in 2017 proved the effectiveness of this two-pronged approach.

  lelantus: Lelantus Activation
  lelantusdesc: Lelantus is our next generation privacy protocol that offers the highest levels of practical privacy without trusted setup and only relying on solid cryptographic assumptions. Lelantus supports anonymity sets that are several magnitudes larger than other privacy systems that do not have trusted setup.
  chainlocks: Chainlocks
  chainlocksdesc: Chainlocks utilize Firo’s masternode network to protect against 51% attacks. Transactions achieve finality as soon as 1 block is confirmed.
  rap: RAP Addresses
  rapdesc: RAP addresses allow a publicly shareable address that does not allow third parties to see how much or when it has received funds.
  instant: Instant Send (in progress)
  instantdesc: Instant Send utilizes Firo’s masternode network to allow transactions to be confirmed within a few seconds allowing for practical use as a medium of exchange.
  elysium: Elysium (in progress)
  elysiumdesc: Elysium allows token (for e.g. stablecoins, asset backed coins) to be issued on Firo’s network that will benefit from Firo’s privacy technology.
  lelantus2: Lelantus 2.0 (work started)
  lelantus2desc: Lelantus 2.0 enables direct anonymous payments allowing users to transact with each other without revealing amounts or source. A new Lelantus address scheme will be deployed allowing users to keep their funds totally hidden.
  mobile: Mobile Wallet and SDK (work started)
  mobiledesc: A native, private by default mobile wallet that will have full Lelantus transaction support. The SDK will allow third party wallets to support Lelantus.
  progpow: ProgPOW (in progress)
  progpowdesc: To further improve ASIC resistance, a ProgPOW variant will replace MTP. This will also allow for much smaller blocks that reduce the bandwidth and storage required of all nodes.
  research: Research
  aura: Aura
  auradesc: Aura is the successor to Lelantus. We intend to improve proving times and increase the anonymity set utilizing our research on hierarchical one-out-of-many proofs. We also are researching various ways to improve the implementation of sliding windows in seeding new anonymity sets.
  bridges: Cross-chain bridges
  bridgesdesc: Cross chain bridges will allow tokens from other ecosystems to bridge in and out of Firo’s Elysium token layer to utilize our privacy infrastructure.
  mixnets: Mixnets
  mixnetsdesc: Tunnelling transactions and node communications into mixnets offer increased metadata protection even against state level adversaries.
  syncclients: Fast sync clients
  syncclientsdesc: Fast sync clients allow users to sync their wallets rapidly without needing to download the entire blockchain while supporting Lelantus transactions.
