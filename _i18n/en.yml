tech:
  heading: Research
  heading1: Privacy is about staying one step ahead. The team behind Firo is responsible for some of the most significant blockchain privacy protocols on record, and all that tech is distilled into Firo.
  academicpapers: Academic Papers
  audits: Audits
  sparklelantus1: Lelantus Spark Technology
  sparklelantus2: Lelantus Spark greatly improves over its predecessor Lelantus with flexible Spark addresses that hide all transaction amounts, are not searchable on the blockchain while allowing efficient threshold signatures and both incoming and outgoing view key support. Spark also has a modular structure allowing components to be upgraded as better technology arises while simplifying security analysis. It retains the benefits of Lelantus with no trusted setup, an easy to understand construction and based on well established cryptographic assumptions.
  lelantus1: Lelantus Technology
  lelantus2: Lelantus is a next-generation privacy protocol developed by Aram Jivanyan at Firo. Lelantus allows you to burn your coins, which hides them in an anonymity set of over 65,000. The receiver can redeem it from this anonymity pool, which breaks the links from your transaction and all the previous ones it has been through.
  sigma1: Sigma Technology
  sigma2: We believe the whole purpose of blockchain is to build systems that do not require trust, and that same principle applies to our privacy systems. This is why we built Sigma for Zcoin in 2018 which removes the requirement of a trusted setup in Zerocoin. Sigma uses 256-bit ECC curves for proof sizes of just 1.5 kB - a 17x improvement on then-current technology. Sigma was a precursor to Lelantus, and set many stepping stones to get us where we are today.
  dandelion1: Dandelion Technology
  dandelion2: Dandelion++ protects your IP address. Before Firo transactions are broadcast to the whole network, they're shuffled between nodes a random number of steps. This way, the origin of the broadcast is decorrelated from your IP address.
  mtp1: Decentralized and fair security
  mtp2: Firo's Merkle Tree Proof (MTP) mining algorithm was designed to democratize mining. The MTP algorithm is memory-intensive increasing the costs of building ASICs and keeping the chain mineable by commodity hardware such as GPUs. Nodes, however, can bypass this memory requirement and verify these proofs efficiently. A Firo-sponsored audit in 2017 proved the effectiveness of this two-pronged approach. MTP has since been replaced by FiroPoW which has smaller proofs and additional ASIC resistant strategies.

roadmap:
  heading: Roadmap
  intro1: Firo has come a long way since its inception as Zcoin, pioneering the use of modern zero-knowledge proofs in a privacy protocol. Over time, we have steadily iterated on our technology, developing some of the most robust privacy protocols in the space — protocols that have influenced many other projects.
  intro2: Our updated roadmap focuses on usability, utility, and upgrades.
  usability: Usability
  usabilityp: Enhancing the user experience, integrating with additional wallets, and supporting light clients.
  utility: Utility
  utilityp: Expanding use cases through private token issuance and implementing further privacy enhancements in preparation for future quantum computing challenges.
  upgrades: Upgrades
  upgradesp: Continuously strengthening the protocol’s core features to maintain Firo’s position as a leader in privacy technology.
  neartermgoals: Near-term goals
  sparknames: Spark Names
  sparknamesp: Allow users to register human-readable addresses tied to their Spark addresses. This also enables storing and sharing metadata for potential use as a decentralized digital identity.
  sparkcoinbase: Spark Coinbase
  sparkcoinbasep: Enable miners and masternodes to send rewards directly to private Spark addresses, further enhancing user privacy and Spark adoption.
  viewkeytooling: View Key Tooling
  viewkeytoolingp: Develop user-friendly methods for sharing and utilizing Spark view keys, enabling watch-only wallets and selectively disclosing Spark-based funds for compliance purposes.
  midtermgoals: Mid-term goals
  sparkassets: Spark Assets
  sparkassetsp: Allow users to issue their own privacy-preserving assets. These assets enjoy the same privacy features as Spark, including the ability to hide asset types. All assets (including Firo) contribute to a shared anonymity set, and the protocol can also support privacy-preserving NFTs.
  sparkswap: Spark Swap
  sparkswapp: Enable atomic swaps between Spark assets and/or Firo, ensuring trustless and private exchanges.
  curvetrees: Curve Trees
  curvetreesp: Adopt Curve Trees, an innovative technique for efficient membership proofs that supports a global anonymity set. This upgrade will substantially improve privacy, scalability, verification speed, and proof size.
  longtermgoals: Long-term goals
  improvedinfra: Improved Privacy-Preserving Light Wallet Infrastructure
  improvedinfrap: Continue researching ways to reduce reliance on customized SPV servers, giving users more private and decentralized light wallet options.

  serai: Serai Integration
  seraip: Collaborate with Serai, a cross-chain DEX focusing on AMM liquidity for Bitcoin, Ethereum, DAI, and Monero. Integrating Firo expands its cross-chain liquidity options and user base.
  iterative: Iterative Improvements
  campfire: Campfire
  campfirep: Continue building out Campfire desktop and mobile wallets to provide full-featured support for masternodes, Spark Assets, and Spark Names.
