tech:
  heading: Research
  heading1: Privacy is about staying one step ahead. The team behind Firo is responsible for some of the most significant blockchain privacy protocols on record, and all that tech is distilled into Firo.
  academicpapers: Academic Papers
  audits: Audits
  sparklelantus1: Lelantus Spark Technology
  sparklelantus2: Lelantus Spark greatly improves over its predecessor Lelantus with flexible Spark addresses that hide all transaction amounts, are not searchable on the blockchain while allowing efficient threshold signatures and both incoming and outgoing view key support. Spark also has a modular structure allowing components to be upgraded as better technology arises while simplifying security analysis. It retains the benefits of Lelantus with no trusted setup, an easy to understand construction and based on well established cryptographic assumptions.
  lelantus1: Lelantus Technology
  lelantus2: Lelantus is a next-generation privacy protocol developed by Aram Jivanyan at Firo. Lelantus allows you to burn your coins, which hides them in an anonymity set of over 65,000. The receiver can redeem it from this anonymity pool, which breaks the links from your transaction and all the previous ones it has been through.
  sigma1: Sigma Technology
  sigma2: We believe the whole purpose of blockchain is to build systems that do not require trust, and that same principle applies to our privacy systems. This is why we built Sigma for Zcoin in 2018 which removes the requirement of a trusted setup in Zerocoin. Sigma uses 256 bit ECC curves for proof sizes of just 1.5 kB - a 17x improvement on then-current technology. Sigma was a precursor to Lelantus, and set many stepping stones to get us where we are today.
  dandelion1: Dandelion Technology
  dandelion2: Dandelion++ protects your IP address. Before Firo transactions are broadcast to the whole network, they’re shuffled between nodes a random number of steps. This way, the origin of the broadcast is decorrelated from your IP address.
  mtp1: Decentralized and fair security
  mtp2: Firo’s Merkle Tree Proof (MTP) mining algorithm was designed to democratize mining. The MTP algorithm is memory-intensive increasing the costs of building ASICs and keeping the chain mineable by commodity hardware such as GPUs. Nodes, however, can bypass this memory requirement and verify these proofs efficiently. A Firo-sponsored audit in 2017 proved the effectiveness of this two-pronged approach. MTP has since been replaced by FiroPoW which has smaller proofs and additional ASIC resistant strategies.

He laid the foundations of Zcoin's (now Firo) technology from coding the world's first implementation of Zerocoin and also pushing for the research and development into the MTP mining algorithm. Poramin has been focused on pushing for the adoption of Firo into the real world especially in his involvement in facilitating the Thai Democrat Party to conduct its primary elections to elect its party leader on Firo's blockchain in 2018 which is the world’s first large scale political election on a blockchain.
