                              <p>Lelantus is a next-generation privacy protocol developed by Aram Jivanyan at Firo. Lelantus allows you to burn your coins, which hides them in an anonymity set of over 65,000. The receiver can redeem it from this anonymity pool, which breaks the links from your transaction and all the previous ones it has been through.</p>

                                      <p class="abstract">Lelantus is Firo’s next generation privacy protocol which improves on Sigma by removing the requirement of fixed denominations allowing people to burn arbitrary amounts and redeem partial amounts without revealing values or the source. Lelantus doesn’t require any trusted setup and uses only DDH assumptions. It also supports untraceable direct anonymous payments by allowing people to pass the right to redeem to someone else. Lelantus is Firo’s own innovation.</p>

                                      <p class="abstract">In this work, we introduce a new method of instantiating one-out-of-many proofs which reduces the proof generation time by an order of magnitude. In certain practical applications our method also helps to fasten the verification process of multiple simultaneously generated proofs. Our approach still results in shorter proofs comprised of only a logarithmic number of commitments and does not compromise the highly efficient batch verification properties endemic to the original construction. We believe this work can also foster further research towards building more efficient one-out-of-many proofs which are extremely useful constructions in the blockchain privacy space and beyond.</p>

                              <h3>Sigma Technology</h3>
                              <p>We believe the whole purpose of blockchain is to build systems that do not require trust, and that same principle applies to our privacy system itself. This is why we built Sigma for Firo in 2018. Sigma uses 256 bit ECC curves for proof sizes of just 1.5 kB - a 17x improvement on then-current technology. Sigma was a precursor to Lelantus, and set many stepping stones to get us where we are today.</p>
